      "Super_Section": "<h4>The fear of difficult conversations is keeping our society stuck in one place. </h4><p>We avoid talking about a living will, changes in our climate, and other sensitive topics because we consider them difficult subjects. However, not all conversations are difficult, and not all conversations should be viewed as such.&nbsp;What makes a difficult conversation?</p><p>A difficult conversation is caused by the desire to change not one, but two things. If we want to say one thing only, we usually don’t consider it a difficult conversation because it’s clear what we want and should do. But when we ask for two things, we feel like we’re asking for too much and hesitate to even discuss it.&nbsp;</p><p>But when other factors are added to the equation, the conversation is not difficult. In fact, it’s often required to help the group, the company, or the entity achieve their common goal.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Authority</h4><p>Exercising your authority and enforcing rules is not a difficult conversation. You shouldn’t care about what the other party is thinking while you’re exercising your authority, because you have the right and responsibility to do so. If you don’t have it or don’t believe in your authority, it’s then when the conversation becomes difficult. You need to have confidence in your authority and not care what the other person thinks.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Enrollment</h4><p>When someone is enrolled in the group and working towards the same goal, there are no difficult conversations. This is because everyone is focused on the same thing and working towards the same goal, so it’s easier to share ideas, resources, and solve problems.</p><p>That’s why the best way to move past a difficult conversation is to spend time on enrollment. When someone is an active member of a company, a group, or a community, it’s easier for them to accept criticism and work towards the same goal.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Direct conversation</h4><p>Once you’ve spent all mutual resources and ways to move forward, it’s best to avoid making a difficult conversation by being direct. Don’t be afraid to say no and be direct about it. If everyone is enrolled in the group, they will want the unit to move forward and will accept your decision more easily.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Respectful ultimatum</h4><p>When you offer a respectful ultimatum to any of the people, it’s not a difficult conversation. Every member has enrolled and agreed on the working standards, so asking them to respect them is not a difficult conversation. If someone is being disrespectful and crossing the lines you and the group have set, set a respectful ultimatum. If they don’t respect it, ask them nicely to do it, or else they will be excluded from the group.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not a difficult conversation. You’re simply asking to work together towards the same goal by maintaining a good working environment.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Contribution</h4><p>Being enrolled in a journey with the group means investing and expecting others to invest their time and resources. It’s a mutual agreement to work towards the same goal as a group, and put the common interest before the personal one.&nbsp;<br></p>",

He is considered one of the most successful investors in the world, with a net worth of 88.9 billion USD as of December 2019, making him the fourth-wealthiest person in the world.</p><p><br></p>",
      "Super_Section": "<h4>The road not taken</h4><p>Andrew made his way from founding a design agency in Canada to creating a multi-million dollar company like Tiny. It all began with the tech news site Andrew launched in high school, through which he claims he received his “MBA-like training”. At 16, he had the opportunity to interview Steve Jobs, and he traveled across the world. After graduating, he moved to Silicon Valley and founded the freelancing agency, Metalab.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon he became the go-to guy for designing web apps, mobile apps, and websites for major corporations like Apple, Google, Walmart, and Facebook. But running an agency was a lot of work, as he always needed to win new clients, so to escape this, Andrew started looking for SAS and recurring revenue. Inspired by the work David and Jason were doing with <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>, he started multiple SAS companies that initially built softwares. He kept diversifying and making new companies, and by 2013, he was CEO of more than five big businesses. Overwhelmed with this life, he started selling some of his companies to generate capital for investment. Learning from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire model, he visualised a similar business model for tech, and founded Tiny.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>I wanna acquire companies like New Zealand</h4><p>Andrew says that he prefers to acquire companies that are like New Zealand - in the middle of nowhere, quietly successful, profitable, not where other investors are looking, and away from nuclear war. He prefers to go for a 10-100 million opportunity rather than a 10 billion one with more risk. Their investments are not always venture capitals; most of them are in bootstrap businesses where founders are paid for a price based on where the company is at that point, what earnings are expected, and what risk it has in the future. Portfolio construction is not a concern at Tiny, as evaluation is done on a deal by deal basis, after judging if the investment will last the test of time. Diversifying is done very cautiously.</p><p></p><p><em>“I think like with a lot of founders I’m very urgent. I love doing things quickly. I love ideas, I love strategy. What I don’t really like is implementation and follow-through and managing people.”</em> -Andrew Wilkinson</p><p>The pandemic has definitely affected revenue models. At Tiny, they still don’t know what the 2nd and 3rd order effects will be, but since all of their companies work remotely, they’ve been able to pivot easily. Some businesses have definitely been affected more, but in those cases, the strategy is to scale down cost and keep an eye on it. Andrew explains that they only buy profitable businesses. The key is sustainability, and growth is only a second priority. He doesn’t believe that it is necessary to sacrifice your profits to be able to show growth.</p><p><br></p><h4>Notes on board leadership</h4><p>When you’re a board member, remember you’re not the CEO’s friend. You are there to ask probing questions and rub their nose in the consequences of what could go wrong. Even if you own the entire company, you can’t dictate what they do. You’re ultimately deciding, ‘Is this the right person to run this business, or not?’ It is useful to think about incentives to align your CEOs, and sometimes CEOs need to make mistakes to learn from them. Even if it may sound like a bad idea, Andrew only intervenes if a bad decision is at a “sink the company '' level. Otherwise he uses the “disagree but commit” strategy. You must definitely double down on your strengths but also make sure you know enough about your weaknesses so you can delegate those parts to people who are good at those aspects. While hiring, Andrew always looks for his candidates’ outcomes. Have they done this before? How well did they do it? In his experience, if you hire for potential it always fails.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I’ve realised that, ultimately, the main things that matter are being able to be part of a community and having activities you can engage in, having friends, and having a wonderful family and grandchildren.”</em> - Andrew Wilkinson</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The problem with current work culture</h4><p>Many entrepreneurs wrongly believe that insufficient sleep does not affect their performance. The current work culture glorifies pulling all-nighters and never stopping the grind. However, constant self-sacrifice is unsustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>Recharging involves more than getting sufficient sleep. Employees and founders also need to lower their stress levels.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“75% of healthcare causes and healthcare problems are stress-related and preventable.”</em> – Arianna Huffington</p><p>There is a Yin and Yang relationship between building one’s startup and refueling.</p><p><em>“The idea is to keep them balanced, not to let one eclipse the other.”</em> – Reid Hoffman&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by her own experience and the prevailing mentality of entrepreneurial culture, Arianna Huffington authored “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804140863?tag=randohouseinc8259-20\"><em>Thrive</em></a>” to bring attention to this toxic culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, suggested to Huffington that she start a company around the valuable insights in her book. Those words planted the seed that culminated in 2016 with Huffington launching “<em>Thrive Global</em>” with the aim of preventing burnout while maximizing efficiency through sleep and rejuvenation.</p><p><br></p><h4>The science behind productivity and sleep</h4><p>Dr. Matt Walker says it has been scientifically proven that insufficient sleep can hinder employees’ productivity and problem-solving capabilities. It also increases the likelihood they will be dishonest or unethical in the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>And these negative impacts affect CEOs’ behavior too.</p><p><em>“The more or less sleep a business leader has had for one night to the next, the more or less charismatic and inspiring the employees will rate that business leader from one day to the next.”</em> – Dr. Matt Walker</p><p>Chris Yeh wrote an essay titled “<a href=\"https://thriveglobal.com/stories/napping-my-way-to-success/\"><em>Napping My Way To Success In Silicon Valley</em></a>” wherein he recounts how a 20-minute nap per day has increased his productivity and greatly contributed to his success over the last decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Scientific research has proven that tiredness impacts our brain’s frontal lobes and impairs our cognitive abilities.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I can trace all of my hiring mistakes to being tired.” </em>– Arianna Huffington</p><p>Rejuvenation sessions do not need to be very lengthy.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Neuroscience tells us it takes under 60 seconds to course correct from stress.”</em> – Arianna Huffington</p><p>This issue extends beyond mental health, it is also about business.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“A founder who has pushed themselves too far and is running on empty becomes a liability to themselves, their employees, and their investors.”</em> - Reid Hoffman</p><p><br></p><h4>Implementing a sustainable work culture in your own life and company</h4><p>Similar to how children also require a bedtime routine, adults also need a transition to sleep, so establish a bedtime ritual. Whether you are an employee or entrepreneur, declare an end to your work day at a set time. Be willing to disconnect from work; switch off your electronics and keep them out of sight.&nbsp;</p><p>When instilling a culture of rejuvenation in your company, always remember that different people have different capacities, priorities, and ways of recharging.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, there will be occasions when employees will have to exert themselves or pull all-nighters to meet deadlines. That is not the issue.</p><p><em>“People never have a problem with what they do occasionally. It’s what’s expected of [them] every day that’s the problem.”</em> – Arianna Huffington</p><p>Implementing “entry interviews” with employees will allow you to learn about their priorities and set up a workspace for them that is in harmony with those priorities.</p><p>Paradoxically, technology can either get in the way of rejuvenation or be used to create/reinforce a healthy work culture.</p><p>Small course corrections in the company culture can have a huge impact on wellness.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The impact of a single angry customer call can cascade through an employee’s day, taking down productivity, team morale, and… employee retention.</em>” – Reid Hoffman</p><p>Any company can implement a sustainable work culture.</p><p><em>“These are small changes that can have a huge impact.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Lessons from Pericles relevant to COVID-19</h4><p></p><p>Pericles was an influential Greek army general and public speaker. He loved rationality and made decisions based on what would benefit the majority, not himself. Unfortunately, the trend among most political leaders today is to focus on benefiting themselves.</p><p></p><p>Like Pericles, leaders should think long-term, develop effective plans for potential crises, and implement them during critical times. Rather than fall into the trap of thinking that favourable circumstances will last indefinitely, leaders must recognize that disasters are inevitable and unpredictable. So they need to plan ahead and successfully persuade the public to stick to the plan.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of our political views, we need to do everything within our power to keep the people around us safe. Though it is fair to say that scientists are still learning about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they still know more than we do. So we must follow their lead if we want to succeed.</p><p><em>“The only way out of this [pandemic] is by following the science.” </em>- Robert Greene</p><p><br></p><h4>The root of unproductive political discussions</h4><p></p><p>Richard Sennett’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Public-Man-Richard-Sennett/dp/0393308790\"><em>The Fall of the Public Man</em></a>, highlights how people’s ego and narcissism are tied up in their politics. For this reason, many people (regardless of political orientation) tend to become <em>personally</em> offended whenever anyone expresses doubt or hostility towards a leader or policy that they support.</p><p><em>“It’s not a Left or Right problem, it’s a cultural problem.” </em>- Robert Greene</p><p></p><p>It is easy to attach one’s own self-worth to how the <em>group</em> is valued. A person may reason, “If you label the person that I voted for as incompetent or immoral, then it’s as though you’re labelling <em>me</em> as incompetent or immoral.” But we must avoid such toxic thinking. As challenging as it may be to do so, we need to separate our self-worth from our politics.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Discussions of different viewpoints should be based on rationality, inner security, and open-mindedness, not emotion. When a person attacks a political view, don’t interpret it as an attack on <em>you</em> as a person. Analyze the value of each idea for yourself; don’t simply rely on what others think. Be open to changing your point of view when presented with logical ideas.</p><p><em>“You have to be more interested in ideas than in your ego.”</em> - Robert Greene</p><p><br></p><h4>Managing Our Emotions and Our Lives</h4><p></p><p>More often than not, we tend to allow our emotions to lead us. So challenge yourself to reflect on and detach from your emotions.</p><p><em>“The only way to be rational in this world is to realize that you are mostly irrational.”</em> - Robert Greene</p><p></p><p>Only if we take the time to be rational first, can we then leverage our emotions. For example, rather than let your anger blind you, analyze what caused it and whether or not it is a justified response. Once you have done so, you can channel that negative emotion into productive results and strategic decisions.</p><p></p><p>The time that you are alive is the only true possession you have. You can choose to either give it away to other people or you can take ownership of it. Look for ways to “own” obstacles by using them as opportunities to discover more about yourself, grow, and be creative.</p><p></p><p>During the lockdown, rather than look for ways to merely distract yourself, take ownership of these stressful circumstances by gaining knowledge and developing new skills. Robert finds that reading books is a great way to “explore” the world and other people’s minds even when you’re stuck at home.&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>We need to re-establish character in the American system</h4><p>David calls John Adams and Thomas Jefferson the frenemies of the Founding. As the declaration of independence says:<em> </em>We are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights<em>. </em>We have a responsibility to exercise our rights in a virtuous manner, and&nbsp;should not take these rights and abuse them.&nbsp;</p><p>Rights-based liberalism is the foundation of the US constitution, but the US government is not effective at enforcing virtue.</p><p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/\">Heraclitus</a> argued that character is fate. With the current situation, David says we are relearning the power of character.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>“Nothing is foolproof against human corruption”</h4><p>There are more and more signs of distrust towards the system, and if political institutions cannot be trusted, the system will break. David argues that there is a need for a reboot of “character”. When the other party cheats, it’s difficult to stick with your integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>Same goes for the media, who treat scandals differently from one person to the next. This makes it impossible to establish a standard, though it’s necessary to establish fair and even standards that apply to all.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Lessons from Iraq and ancient Consantinople</h4><p>Islamic denominations <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam\">Sunni</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam\">Shia</a> could not identify the difference in government style whether the Sunni or Shia ruled, but they remember exactly when one party attacked the other. It seems like we, too, now only remember attacks.</p><p>Chariot racing became a form of politics in Constantinople, when the empire was just about to fall. This is an example of turning politics into sports.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>The Misuse of Twitter in politics</h4><p>Today’s chariot racing revolves around social media, and everyone in politics and the media are obsessively using Twitter, creating a toxic environment that sadly determines national mood and policy.</p><p>“Everyone is always airing their grievances….There is an enormous amount of misery out there.” - David French&nbsp;</p><p>Kindness is seen as a weakness on Twitter. You are being forced to be angry, and many people assume that the opposite end of the political spectrum has no knowledge or wisdom to offer. We need to be open to critique.</p><p>‍</p><h4>“<a href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2019/05/against-david-french-ism\">David Frenchism</a>” and the Drag Queen Story Hour</h4><p>David had to defend himself and the American Founding after taking a positive stance towards Drag Queen Story Hour, a movement in Sacramento, California where drag queens read to children. Following this, people tried to discredit the movement of David French by discrediting the creator himself.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p></p><h4>Are we doing a bad job telling the story of American history?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>“The entire Bill of Rights is a firewall against majoritarian tyranny”. -David French&nbsp;</p><p>The focus lies mostly on unimportant issues like Drag Queen Story Hour, and only sometimes is it used to stop civil wars. Americans have failed to fulfill the ideas of the founding fathers, and again and again the Bill of Rights has been violated, from slavery to post-WW2 social segregation.</p><p>The founders set up a system motivated by a political ideology that had irreconcilable tensions with existing oppressive structures. This resulted in the constant push for liberty, even though it took a while. There are always two sides to any battle, and the outcome depends on which side is being portrayed as heroes.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>What should people working in the federal government do now?&nbsp;</h4><p>There is a lot of tension in the federal government at the moment. People need to watch out not to become instruments of dishonesty. There is a dire need for good people in the government, however if a good person is serving a broken system, they may get broken too. Politicians feel that they are indispensable, and are unwilling to let go of their power. They should recognize the time when their ego led them to stop serving their country, and resign.</p>",

Finding an empathy touchpoint is important. The <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286537/\">Food Inc</a>. documentary, for example, created empathy to get its point across.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It’s important to explain basic concepts of scarcity. Time is your only really scarce resource, and on average we have 600,000 hours to live. Everyday you exchange your time for pieces of paper that are created out of thin air. Why would you exchange your finite time for something infinite?</p><p></p><p>Misir’s book was inspired by the movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/\">In Time</a>, which explains the concept of “time is money”. In the movie, the rich have thousands of years to live whereas the poor only have days, sometimes hours.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p></p><h4><strong>Why should you read the book?</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>It explains in a very simplistic way how bitcoin saves you time.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Money should be limited in supply, but it’s not. The result is that we spend more time working than we should. With an inflation rate of 5% per year, it means that after five years your money is worth 50% less. Savings are therefore not reliable.</p><p><br></p><h4>Shrinkflation: the insidious method to hide the problems of capitalism&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>The first 7-8 chapters of the book do not mention bitcoin.

In 2018, it has shrunk to 167 grams and costs £1.26 = 28% smaller and 71% more expensive.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Introduction to FringeSport&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Peter Keller’s passion for fitness moved him to start <a href=\"https://www.fringesport.com/blogs/news\">FringeSport</a> in 2010, with the aim to “help people improve their lives through strength.” FringeSport is a direct-to-consumer company that sells gym equipment to customers who want to establish their own garage gyms, or set up a community gym.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Thinking like a “3rd-century trader”</h4><p></p><p>Rather than go down the more common path of starting a venture-backed direct-to-consumer (or D2C) company, Peter established FringeSport as a bootstrap direct-to-consumer company.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This means that the only capital he raised to start FringeSport was his own money, with no outside investors at all. While modern business philosophy emphasizes scaling and customer acquisition first, and profits second, Peter flipped the script and approached it like a “3rd-century trader”. This meant using only (1) his limited capital and (2) his skills as an entrepreneur to make a profit with every sale while creating value for customers.</p><p></p><p>Without external funding, Peter has the freedom and control to steer the company wherever he believes would be best for it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I haven’t had to sacrifice what I believed was in the best interest of our customers.”</em> - Peter Keller</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Peter reminds listeners that choosing this path means it would take a while for a business to reach a sizable scale, but he personally believes it will be worthwhile.</p><p><em>“You can ultimately be in charge of your destiny if you’re willing to grow a little slower.” </em>- Peter Keller</p><p><br></p><h4>Customer acquisition without advertisements</h4><p></p><p>Peter referenced an eye-opening article titled “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dunn/start-up-drugs-922fdc3a57c8\">Start-Up Drugs</a>”, wherein Andy Dunn likens advertisements to drugs for start-ups because they make entrepreneurs feel good (by providing revenue) -- but at a high cost.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Many entrepreneurs are anxious that if they stop spending so much money on advertisements, their revenue will disappear. But Peter has found an alternative way to acquire customers. FringeSport employs a content-focused marketing strategy. In other words, FringeSport generates free, helpful, and valuable content to help their customers.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Whether it is through blog posts, participating in offsite web forums, or creating detailed and informative product pages, FringeSport generates free content that answers customers’ questions and helps them make wise consumer decisions, even if that means they will buy from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This strategy is not about trying to get customers to buy FringeSport’s products, but rather to establish a connection with them. He views this strategy as a way to give back to his customers, which is preferable to giving money to Facebook or Google for ads.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>A clear vision and mission</h4><p></p><p>Peter is passionate about “helping people improve their lives through strength.” It is this conviction that drives him to provide his customers with quality products and practical advice. Despite the bootstrap technique, he still has big dreams for FringeSport. He aims to build it an international reputation as the best place for community and information regarding the garage and community gym movements.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Because he has such a deep understanding of his customers and what they’re trying to achieve, Peter has been able to make company decisions with their best interests at heart. This technique is not new by any means. Companies like Patagonia also focused on their customers, and they are still around today.</p><p><em>“I would be overjoyed to pilot Fringe[Sport] into the future more or less forever.”</em> - Peter Keller</p><p>‍</p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Clone or create?<br></h4><p>Aaron Tan started his first company when he was 13, and had already sold two companies by the time he turned 20. However, his entrepreneurial career got sidetracked when he accepted a government scholarship to pursue computer science education in the United States.</p><p>When he returned to Singapore, he worked at venture capital firm Singtel. After having fulfilled his obligations, he decided to get back to starting companies again, and having dealt with automotive companies while in venture capital, he focused on the automotive business because of its great potential. He was inspired to start his company when he looked back on his years in the US, where he had bought several cars using services like Carfax and Kelley Blue Book, which provide information about a car’s condition, history, and value. These kinds of services did not exist in Southeast Asia.</p><p><em>“So I don’t think that there is a need to be super innovative and come up with something that is entirely unique. I think there are gaps in the market, but not all gaps are equally translatable.” </em>- Aaron Tan</p><p>What this teaches us is that building a new business isn’t always about creating a new model. Sometimes, understanding the market you’re after and the viable opportunities is what’s important.</p><p><br></p><h4>It’s all about priorities!</h4><p>Tan says his business focus shifts every few months. Right now, during the COVID-19 outbreak, he is mainly focused on managing cash and hiring more engineers that can work from home.</p><p><em>“The two things we’re investing in are growth and making sure that the company stays afloat for a long, long time.”</em></p><p>The engineers are busy because they are working on the business’s platform, so that Carro can be prepared for whatever other challenges the future may bring.</p><p><br></p><h4>Maintaining an open culture</h4><p>With Carro’s operations split across different countries - and different languages -, Tan believes in a “divide and conquer” approach. The company is divided into different teams, which operate on their own under guidelines set up by the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, Carro has worked on and improved their process of company-wide communication, getting feedback from staff members, and being transparent to employees about what was happening in other parts of the company.</p><p>On that note, Tan describes Carro’s culture with one word: open.</p><p><em>“I don’t think we have an internal issue where people don’t speak up, so for me it’s about making sure people give useful feedback. Has it been useful? I think so.”</em></p><p>When asked what kind of people he wants working for his company, Tan said he looks for individuals who are more focused on governance than on being mavericks.</p><h4>‍<br>Sprinting and going all in</h4><p>After finishing his conversation with Tan, Venture host Andrew Roth spoke with fellow McKinsey associate Tomas Laboutka, another experienced entrepreneur, about the steps Tan took to start his company: evaluating what the key segments were for the automotive market, what services were missing and whether or not it could work in Tan’s region, and whether or not there was a strong player already in the market there.</p><p><em>“After getting all the answers, which drove him toward Carro, he just started sprinting, with focus, and went all in.” </em>- Tomas Laboutka</p><p>Laboutka and Roth also remarked how Carro is moving forward with investing, even during a global pandemic when economic activity is otherwise at a standstill. On the one hand, you make sure your financial “burn” is kept as low as possible, but on the other hand, you move forward and make bold moves with investing in talent and building up a culture that can ensure your company lasts for years to come.<br><br><em>“This was something that really struck me as he spoke about the 400 people whom he ultimately asks, not anonymously, what it is that he should be focusing on, and where they should go. So being open is something that really stood out.”</em><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Disclaimer<strong>:</strong> The information discussed by Dr. Rhonda Patrick is not meant to diagnose or treat any disease.&nbsp;</h4><p>When studying COVID-19, do not make the common mistake of drawing broad conclusions from an isolated fact because this will lead to wrong solutions.</p><h4>‍<strong><br></strong>Children and COVID-19</h4><p>A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7.pdf\">March 2020 study</a> found that children of all ages (regardless of gender) are susceptible to COVID-19. However, children at higher risk include:</p><ul><li>Infants and preschoolers</li><li>Immunocompromised children</li><li>Children with other pulmonary health problems</li></ul><p>Manifestations of COVID-19 symptoms in children have generally been milder compared to the symptoms in adults. Furthermore, COVID-19 related deaths among children have been extremely rare.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Children’s immune systems are still developing and may respond to pathogens very differently from adults.”</em> - Dr. Rhonda Patrick</p><p>Studies have found no evidence of mother-child transmission of COVID-19 either through pregnancy or through breastfeeding. Hence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that nursing mothers who tested positive for the virus wash their hands before touching their infants and wear face masks while breastfeeding.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19</h4><p>Hydroxychloroquine is an inexpensive generic drug known for treating rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. It should not be taken at home without a physician’s guidance because its side effects include:</p><ul><li>Gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, etc.)</li><li>Retinopathy</li></ul><p>Only limited (and conflicted) data is available regarding its effectiveness in treating COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Larger randomized control trials are needed to confirm whether or not hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19.”</em> - Dr. Rhonda Patrick</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Quercetin and COVID-19</h4><p>Quercetin is a flavonoid found in plants and is an FDA-approved drug ingredient. While it was proven effective in blocking the original virus that caused the initial outbreak (SARS-CoV-1), it has not been clinically tested for the current version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2).&nbsp;</p><p>Canada and China are collaborating on a clinical trial using it; the results are expected to come out in four months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Blood types and COVID-19</h4><p>There is “very little evidence” that Type A blood groups are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to non-Type A groups. It is possible that Type O blood groups may have a lower risk of infection due to the types of antibodies their blood produces. Most of this limited evidence is connected to SARS-CoV-1, not the current version of the virus.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Vitamin D and COVID-19</h4><p>While it is well-established that Vitamin D plays an important role in immune defense in general and that it can be protective against respiratory tract infections, its effect on COVID-19 is still unclear.</p><p><em>“Whether Vitamin D really does play a crucial role in COVID-19 defense — only time will tell.”</em> - Dr. Rhonda Patrick</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Saunas and COVID-19</h4><p>There is no official data to suggest that saunas, hot baths, steam showers, etc. could affect COVID-19 at all. However, there is a <a href=\"https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(17)30357-8/fulltext\">2017 study</a> that examines the effects of sauna use on pneumonia (a symptom of severe COVID-19 illness).</p><p>‍</p><h4>Intravenous Vitamin C and COVID-19</h4><p>There is evidence regarding Vitamin C’s positive impact for patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Sepsis. But there is no published data regarding the effects on treating COVID-19 specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>There is only anecdotal evidence from physicians in China, but these are not peer-reviewed. An ongoing trial in China using Vitamin C (which will conclude on September 30th, 2020) could provide insights.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h4>Melatonin and COVID-19</h4><p>Melatonin is a hormone that activates the immune system when needed and reduces inflammation.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Working in the COVID ward</h4><p>The start was very dramatic, wearing scary-looking hazmat suits. Patients were put on mechanical ventilators, and the emergency room changed overnight.</p><p>After a dramatic rise, the number of cases plateaued, and non-COVID-19 related cases are starting to return. Dr. Ku believes, however, that there will most likely be a second wave of COVID-19 in fall and winter.</p><p>Regarding his own health, Dr. Ku explains:​“I don't think about my own health that much, because I had already resigned myself to probably getting COVID-19 from the beginning, and that it is a risk that I take.”</p><p><em>“The mental stress is always in the back of our minds,” and he says one of the hardest things is not being able to hug his kids when he gets home. It’s hard for them to understand what is going on. My kids have seen me crying this week.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h4>Recognizing relevant information on social media</h4><p>There is a large amount of misinformation circulating. Dr. Ku is learning from trustworthy doctors by following them on Twitter, or listening to their podcasts and blogs.</p><p>He feels the <a href=\"https://guides.dml.georgetown.edu/openaccess/FOAM\">FOAM</a> (free open access in medicine) community and Dr. Richard Levitan are trustworthy sources of information.</p><p>On the other hand, the U.S healthcare system is fractured as data from electronic health records are siloed. Electronic health records are designed for billing, not for real time decision making. The crisis teaches us that data systems need to be redesigned.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>Tech helping ease life or death decisions</h4><p>In early March, it was projected that we would not have enough ventilators, so collaborating with MIT on a bridge ventilator was crucial. <a href=\"https://newlab.com/\">New Lab </a>and <a href=\"https://www.10xbeta.com/\">10XBeta</a> designed and manufactured a new ventilator in just one month.</p><p>Swabs - the little sticks that are put into the patient's nose to test for COVID-19 -, were 3D printed due to severe shortages. The entire lab was repurposed for printing testing swabs.</p><p>‍</p><h4>“We are running out of the most basic medications”</h4><p>There were not enough meds available to sedate patients to be intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 has completely overwhelmed the supply chains in a matter of weeks.</p><p>Hospitals were not designed for pandemics, and some are closing down and laying off healthcare workers. Still, some data shows a 40-50% decline in emergency room visits, possibly because people may be afraid to go to the hospital. Not all hospitals are overloaded like those in New York City, however, and most are safe and can accommodate patients. Dr. Ku fears collateral damage from COVID-19 may be worse than the virus itself.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Telemedicine is here to stay</h4><p>Telemedicine will become a backbone of the healthcare delivery system, and will play a major role in redesigning this system. It will also help protect the underprivileged: the virus has killed many people with unstable housing, in factory jobs, and in the prison systems.</p><p>There needs to be a federal, national unified strategy for the U.S. healthcare system, and this crisis is an opportunity to fundamentally redesign this system.</p><p>We are never going back to the old normal.</p><h4>Connecting to colleagues is important during these times</h4><p>300 ER doctors joined a Zoom memorial service for one of their colleagues, who worked in NYC and commited suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Ku also learned that two of his colleagues mum’s died of COVID-19.</p><p><em>“I am fortunate to have a job where I can go and actually make a difference during this time.”</em> - Dr. Bon Ku<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Know your immune system</h4><p>Many studies have shown that genetics is not a major regulator of immune response, unlike age and environment. Previous exposure to viruses like <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cmv/symptoms-causes/syc-20355358\">Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</a> can also play a major role. In younger adults, this exposure enhances immune function but if you're old, it's deleterious as the virus trains your T-cells to respond to CMV only, which causes a weakened immune response to other viruses. Blood types also play a role in immune response to viruses. Type O blood makes type A antibodies, and these people show less frequency of getting COVID-19. Type Os also seem to have lower levels of the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/von-willebrand-factor\">Von Willebrand</a> factor that is involved in clotting, which may help protect against COVID-19.</p><p><em><br></em></p><h4>Status of treatment against SARS-CoV-2</h4><p>15-30% of common cold infections are attributed to coronavirus, so the theory of cross-immunity across viruses gives hope that common cold antibodies may work on COVID-19. Belgian researchers saw that llamas seem to contain antibodies that can neutralize COVID-19 by binding on the spike protein site, however this is a short-lived solution due to problems in mass production.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, antibody dependent enhancement is a big concern.There are multiple virus strains identified within the SARS-CoV-2. Two particularly interesting ones are the mutations in the spike protein region - the aspartate to glycine mutation. Asians (predominantly in China) have a dominant presence of the aspartate form, while the glycine mutant is prominent in Europeans. This mutation is perhaps causing a higher mortality rate in Europe than in Asia.</p><p><em><br></em></p><h4>Are vitamins the body armour you need in this war?</h4><p>A study from the Philippines showed that for every standard deviation increase in vitamin D level, people were eight times less likely to have a severe form of COVID-19, and 20 times less likely to be critically ill. 70% of the US population is deficient of vitamin D (&lt;30ng/ml), which your body is supposed to automatically make from exposure to UVB radiation in sunlight. But in non-equatorial countries, exposure to it does not occur all year round and the melanin content in skin blocks this radiation, so people with dark skin now living in temperate regions become severely deficient. African-Americans are seen to be 28 times more deficient in vitamin D than Caucasians. Additionally, elderly and obese people are also more likely to be deficient because this vitamin is fat soluble. Vitamin D is very important for respiratory resilience because it causes homeostasis, but doesn't cause side-effects like increasing <a href=\"https://www.rndsystems.com/resources/articles/ace-2-sars-receptor-identified\">Ace2</a> receptors.</p><p>In her article on the <a href=\"https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/vitamin-c\">importance of vitamin C</a>, Dr.Rhonda explains the difference between the oral and IV forms. Ongoing research in China and the US examine if it helps with COVID-19 resilience. Zinc, also important for the immune system, is found mainly in poultry and red meat. That’s why vegetarians are more prone to zinc deficiency, which can damage T-cell function. Flavonoids like quercetin, found in apples, tea and buckwheat, are also important and have been identified to help against SARS-COV-1 due to their senolytic properties.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Relaxation is the key to staying healthy</h4><p>Many studies have shown that sauna/hot baths mimic cardio-vascular exercise in terms of the effects they have on your body. This practice can also help with sleep and have antidepressant effects on your mind. Infrared saunas have been shown to treat chronic cardiovascular diseases in some cases. Hot baths increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which regulates neuroplasticity in adults.They also increase heat shock proteins in your body which prevent neuro-degenerative diseases. Cold showers/ice baths after saunas release cold shock proteins that are known to regulate moods and focus attention through norepinephrine release.</p><p>Sleep is also crucial for immune function. Melatonin and bright light exposure in the early morning work wonders in setting your circadian clock, while using blue-light blocking glasses for looking at screens may help you sleep better. CBD can help relieve anxiety and stress.</p><h5><br></h5>",

This is because during mental rehearsal, the brain is still producing the same commands as it would during a physical rehearsal. The only difference is that it is not sending the commands to the muscles.</p><p></p><p>Based on this evidence, Professor Erlacher has formulated a theory that practicing a motor or sport skill during a lucid dream can improve your performance of the skill in real life. To test it, he conducted a <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1123/tsp.24.2.157\">pilot study</a> where participants were asked to practice a simple motor task in their lucid dreams. For example, tossing a ten-cent coin into a cup. Participants who were able to practice their assigned task in their lucid dreams showed an improvement in their real-world performance. Professor Erlacher has also gathered anecdotal evidence from athletes in favor of this theory.</p><p></p><p>Lucid dream therapy is also being used to help people who suffer from recurring nightmares.<br></p><p></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>In times of crisis, people need to find their people</h4><p>Community is very important at times like these. There are two sides to the pandemic coin - the health and business side, where the situation is pretty bad, and the opportunity side, where more people are online, looking to use this time to learn new skills and pursue passions. In a crisis like this, we can’t experience community the way we usually do in churches or through sports, but people still crave it. Innovation and adaptation are key to surviving this pandemic.</p><p><br></p><h4>What makes a great membership?</h4><p>Stu McLaren breaks down the key parameters that determine a great membership:</p><ol><li>Can you solve an ongoing problem? <br>In weight loss, for example, nobody goes from being obese to healthy in a flash. It is a journey, so thereby a good fit for membership.</li><li>Can you teach a new skill?<br>The same goes for learning a skill. Learning a musical instrument takes weeks, and membership can help regulate this journey.</li><li>Can you make someone’s life convenient?<br>Why would people buy from me if there is free information already out there? It takes a huge amount of time to sort through that information so people will pay for convenience.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h4>Course vs membership</h4><p>The first thing you need to know is that it is not an either-or relationship between courses and membership. If you teach people a course, you still need membership to help them implement what they’ve learned. There are two kinds of membership types - front-end membership and back-end membership. Front-end membership brings a lot of new people into your world who are going to enroll in your course as members. On the other hand, back-end membership perfectly complements the course as that’s where people are supported. The only difference is that members are initiated after they have seen what you have to offer.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Starting from zero: the power of a founding-member launch</h4><p>To get started with a membership business, you just need an audience of a few hundred people, not tens of thousands. Founding member launches are the best way to create momentum and validate your ideas. Such a launch consists of five components:</p><ol><li>Talk about the idea - explain the idea of your membership and where it came from.</li><li>Cast the vision - and observe the responses you get.</li><li>Invite others to join as a founding member - lock prices for founding members and let them have an active say.</li><li>Call to action - ask for a vote on going ahead.&nbsp;</li><li>Follow-up - no need for a fancy checkout page, but coming through is important.</li></ol><p>This stage is not about revenue but how well you serve these founding members. Creating stories will set you up for when you do launch your membership to the general public.</p><p><br></p><h4>Pricing - should I go high or low?</h4><p>Front-end membership is usually a lower price point (10-100$/month). Start lower and raise them later; your founding members will feel rewarded. When you overprice and then bring it down, existing members feel like they have been overpaying all this time. Back-end membership has a higher price point (100-800$/month) because people already know the value of what you are offering. Make sure you pick the right membership category before you start. Begin thinking about how to add recurrent revenue to your business. This creates stability, brings back customers more regularly, and reduces stress.</p><p><br></p><h4>Tribes</h4><p>Starting April 23rd, Stu is going to be hosting an annual free workshop consisting of three stages. The first live training helps identify whether a membership is a good fit for your business or not. It also addresses what type of membership would suit your market. Next, we talk about what content you will be offering in your membership. Subscribers usually cancel their membership when overwhelmed with content. Finally, we try to break down five key areas of a membership - strategy for foundation, content, marketing, retention and growth.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>How <a href=\"https://www.youprobablyneedahaircut.com/\">YouProbablyNeedAHaircut</a> came to be</h4><p></p><p>At the beginning of the interview, Greg discusses how the idea of his viral website came to be. The simple principle of going online and getting matched with a hairstylist who will show you how you (or your friend) can do your hair worked wonders. The idea went so viral that they had over 150,000 unique users in the first day alone.</p><p><br></p><h4>When Greg Isenberg became a millionaire<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><p></p><p>Not a lot of people know that Greg had a humble start as an affiliate marketer back in 2008, when he was just a teenager. This experience allowed him to learn what people want, so he started his own landing page and invested $100 a month in it while analyzing how he could attract more traffic every day. This was one of his first appearances in Silicon Valley. He then started building websites through an agency, and did some high-profile projects including a redesign of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a>, <a href=\"https://startcooking.com/\">StartCooking</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com/\">WallStreetSurvivor</a>, a move that launched his career as an entrepreneur.</p><p><br></p><h4>Building your network&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Greg and Shaan discuss how Greg was building his network and analyzing the community so he could create a website that meets the community’s needs while promoting it through popular entrepreneurs’ websites. He was organizing parties at his San Francisco home where he met fellow entrepreneurs, who were pitching different ideas and sharing their experiences. It was here that he met the creator of <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\">Uber</a>, who shared his idea of the app. Greg initially thought Uber wouldn’t work, but since it was the 2010s, people were hyped about new technologies and convenient ways of doing regular daily tasks, including transportation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>How Greg sold his successful websites</h4><p></p><p>One of Greg’s websites was <a href=\"https://islands.im/\">Islands</a>, a social network website where students could create groups and chat with each other. The website was showing signs of success before launching, but since social networks weren’t as popular to investors, it was sold to <a href=\"https://www.wework.com/\">WeWork</a>. &nbsp;If the idea isn’t big and can bring a lot of money, it’s time to find it a new home, and that’s exactly what Greg did with Islands.</p><p><br></p><h4>How to create a viral website</h4><p>A good idea is an idea that can advertise itself. Whenever he plans a new website, the first thing Greg analyzes is how much media attention it can get, and if people would want to talk about it and share it with others.</p><p><br></p><h4>Why Evan Spiegel’s Snapchat was so successful</h4><p></p><p>In one segment of the interview, Greg and Shaan discuss a video where <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a>’s founder presents the whole concept of the app. Instead of reverse chronological stories that were on the market up until then (mails, messages, etc.), Snapchat showed the story from beginning to end, as the presenter wanted it to look.&nbsp;</p><p>It also helped people use photos, not as memories, but to tell a story and convey their emotions more realistically, something that wasn’t present on the market up until then. It was so appealing to people because it took something complicated and made it simple, a key factor in creating viral websites.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Offering your unique insight is key to creating a successful business</h4><p></p><p>At the end of this interview, Shaan and Greg share their views of why and how everyone can make a website by using their current knowledge and past experiences. The case they make about this is:</p><ul><li>Every person has a unique insight they can build a website around.&nbsp;</li><li>Everyone has a characteristic or a habit others view as abnormal that can be shared with the world.&nbsp;</li><li>Instead of trying to create a company from new things, create it from what you’ve been interested in&nbsp;</li><li>Ask the question, “Wouldn’t it be cool if…” and work your idea around it. Businesses are created under these types of ideas, and voids they can fill.</li><li>You need a product that is simple, solves a real problem, and adds real value to people’s lives</li></ul>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Jumping to the occasion</h4><p></p><p>The unprecedented upheavals caused by Covid-19 are forcing business leaders and, in many cases, entrepreneurs, to radically rethink and devise new ways to help them survive the disruptions caused by the global crises. Big and small businesses faced with a significant increase or decrease in demand are having to rise to the occasion, with exceptional resilience, in order to merely stay afloat.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Both Slack and Springfree Trampolines, two seemingly different businesses at surface-level, have been heavily sought to alleviate the growing pains individuals and companies alike are experiencing as they’re forced to reassess their day-to-day functioning.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Be open to change&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Jarring as it may seem, the more open we are to change, the more we invite possibility in. While initially a forced re-imagining of the workplace may have seemed intimidating and impossible to many, businesses around the globe have had their thinking shoved outside the box for better or worse, and many have successfully adapted. While Butterfield acknowledges that this initial shift can be somewhat painful, he offers a more positive outlook towards change, reminding business leaders that when the ‘impossible’ is achieved, opportunities they had never imagined may suddenly appear possible.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, Butterfield sees opportunity in the increasing acceptance of technology in the workplace and the efficiency that accompanies it, and he suggests taking advantage of the multitude of communication tools available, playing with them, and finding what best suits your needs.</p><p><br></p><h4>Be there for your people&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Faced with a demand in product 300% higher than normal, Springfree Trampolines has been inundated with families, trapped in their homes, in search of solace in the form of the entertainment, exercise, and familial cohesion that trampolines provide. Co-founder Holmes - whose love of business ultimately stems from his love of people -, overwhelmed with the way that his employees have stepped up to answer the call of the pandemic, stresses the importance of a transparent and supportive environment in fostering a unified team to overcome obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This notion that people thrive when working within a framework of clarity and purpose holds true, pandemic or not. But Butterfield also drives this point home when he reminds business leaders that, especially “in times of crises like this…people have a really strong instinct to help. And if there’s a place for you to put that energy, it’s not just productive and effective, it’s also kind of spiritually calming.”&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, uncertainty breeds discord, and business leaders must be there in times like these to provide a clear and concise plan to their employees, while reassuring each and every one of them of their specific role within it. A business is only as good as its team.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Do not concede&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>While many businesses may achieve a successful pivot and find themselves on the other side of this disruption relatively unscathed, the unfortunate truth is that there will be many, big and small, who will succumb to the wounds this pandemic has inflicted. Holmes has been there, has witnessed company collapse first hand, and reflects on the wisdom of his father that ultimately got him through it - to get back to work.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Whether employer or employee, it is in these crucial moments of collapse where the resilience and drive that got you to where you are in the first place must be remembered and held close as you continue to look forward.</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Supporting community and businesses in difficult times</h4><p></p><p>DoorDash currently occupies 35% of the food delivery market in the US. With many businesses in travel, services, local retail and restaurants affected due to the pandemic, Tony explains how kitchens are still thriving. Delivery and take-out have become the lifeline of the food business, and restaurants are starting to adapt.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As owner of DoorDash, Tony’s main focus is on how to keep these restaurants afloat, and he does this by investing in marketing for restaurants to keep sales up. They also need to make sure drivers are safe and protected with sanitary equipment and access to diagnostics. On the consumer end, they want to speed up expansion of services to delivery of essentials as soon as possible to assist the vulnerable. Uplifting the community is also a central goal by giving free delivery to health-care workers nation-wide and delivering meals to school children who otherwise don’t have that access. Social responsibility is pronounced now more than ever. Although many customers are skipping tips during this situation, many have found other ways of giving like thank you notes or flowers.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>According to Tony, consumer behavior across most states has remained similar. Right after the state “shelter in place” announcements, people started hoarding groceries and essentials, and emptying department stores. But after about two weeks, consumers started to revert back to old behaviors, seeking convenience and ordering food from outside. New York City was an exception however, because a lot of people commute to the city for work so delivery volume was impacted negatively during lockdown.</p><p></p><p>The super-energised team at DoorDash wants to make sure they are staying true partners to cities, aiming to ensure flexibility and providing resources for them to stay on the road. Their initiatives to partner with the community will continue in the future, even after the crisis is gone.</p><p><br></p><h4>Learn to make hay not just when the sun shines, but on cloudy days too</h4><p></p><p>Marcia’s retail footwear business, FlitFlop, with supply in over 65 different countries, lost momentum due to the pandemic, with orders cancelling out all the way to the end of the year. Beauty Pie, her cosmetics line, was supposed to open a popup shop in London in March, which got cancelled due to Covid-19. But she has instead turned the tables by quickly adapting to this challenging market. </p><p>FlitFlop saw a huge increase in online sales, while Beauty Pie has welcomed four times the new members online. So what if there’s a pandemic? People still need to look good on video calls, and it is in times of stress that we find it important to take care of ourselves.The ability to connect with people online will be the greatest advantage in current times, next to the size of your network and your authenticity.</p><p></p><p>So how can you run remote businesses effectively? Storytelling is a big part of remote collaboration. You need to build up anticipation, which takes some practice but is do-able if you are in-tune to your audience. Try to write down feedback each time you finish a pitch and get on top of that learning curve. This is a moment for opportunity, as big ideas usually come from an individual’s difficulties and fears. You must show flexibility as well as direction. It’s a time when you don’t have much to lose.</p><p></p><p>Inventory and product roll-out can be tricky in current situations. Marcia believes that pausing a product is better than cancelling it. That way, when you release it next year, no one will know that the product is not new except you. It is key to stay positive and not get anxious. Learn the jobs that you can’t outsource and do them yourself. The time will come when you can hire someone else and this knowledge will be an asset in managing them. Be positive and remember that negative moments are temporary. Gratitude for what you have can go a long way in shaping your mood. Look at anything hard as nothing but a learning experience.&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Dom’s journey with ketones</h4><p>Dom’s first introduction to ketones was when he started his US Navy-funded post-doc studying oxygen toxicity seizures. His aim was to develop tech to understand how navy seals could perform physically in extreme deep-sea conditions. In his study, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2692867/\">Jong Rho</a> talked about exogenous ketone potential and the therapeutic applications of ketone, which inspired Dom to look into its application in seizures. </p><p>At that time, the DARPA was also funding research into the nutritional benefits of ketones, which gave Dom the access to these compounds. Dom discovered that elevating blood ketone provides metabolic resilience and prevents seizures in extreme environments. It actually works better than drugs and has no side effects. A ketogenic diet is a high-fat low-carb diet that has been shown to reduce/prevent a majority of seizure types and help treat epilepsy.</p><p><br></p><h4>The inner workings of ketones</h4><p>Dom emphasises the fact that individual ketone levels matter, and not all ketones/ ketone products are the same. It has been observed that when you mix ketogenic fats with salts and esters, a more enhanced response is observed as compared to consuming either alone. There are dozens of potential mechanisms behind a ketogenic diet and its neurological effects, but Dom explains the top four:</p><ol><li>A ketogenic diet has been shown to enhance your brain energy metabolism, and balance your energy and glucose metabolism (homeostasis)</li><li>A ketogenic diet can completely relax your brain by activating an enzyme that converts glutamate (a hyper-activity enzyme) to GABA, an inhibitory brain stabilizing neurotransmitter. These findings have also led to research on other neurological disorders.&nbsp;</li><li>This diet activates the adenosine 1 receptor, which quiets and stabilizes neurotransmission in your brain.</li><li>Ketone bodies have anti-inflammatory properties which reduce neuro-inflammation triggered by foods, stress, environmental toxins, etc. Such events of neuro-inflammation can lead to seizures, anxiety, and headaches.</li></ol><p><br></p><h4>New modifications to ketogenic diets</h4><p>New evidence is indicating that a modified and more relaxed ketogenic diet is more beneficial than a conservative one in terms of compliance and efficacy. The classic ketogenic diet for treating seizures contains 4x as much fat as protein and carbohydrates combined, that is, a 4:1 ratio. As the exact ideal ratio is unknown, it seems like you can incorporate fats that are ketogenic into a diet with a higher protein ratio and get the same level of ketosis. In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983110/\">recent study</a>, it was shown that children with epilepsy on a protein-liberal modified ketogenic diet did better than when they were put on a restrictive ketogenic diet.</p><p><br></p><h4>Anti-catabolic effects of ketones</h4><p>Many studies have indicated that ketones protect muscle mass in the body from being broken down. In times of fasting (approx. 1 week), when your blood glucose levels are low, your body starts to breakdown protein and fatty acid for fuel. The depletion of glycogen stores triggers the production of more ketone bodies to replace glucose as a primary energy source. This mechanism is very relevant in the context of calorie restriction or cancer cachexia (muscle wasting in cancer). Ketones supply an energy source which allows your body to spare amino acids thereby maintaining lean body mass.<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The riches are in the niches.</h4><p>Home-schooling is becoming more prevalent because of the corona-virus. This has driven more teachers to teach online and seek for online trainings. Online workshops have definitely made it easier for teachers to make their classes private, customizable, and equally engaging as classroom-setting teaching.</p><p>For Rick, finding a niche that you can further explore and expand is the key to building a successful business. With his newfound success in the growing community of online teachers, Rick has gained popularity in the teaching space in Germany. Rick has helped a lot of teachers grow their business with the help of his online workshops, in the same way that they have helped him grow his programs through their continuous sharing of stories of struggles, recommendations, and experiences. He believes that platforms like Teachers Pay Teachers — an online marketplace for educational materials for teachers by teachers — is an interesting niche to learn. Studying the mindsets and challenges of the teachers in platforms like these can help you mold your teaching programs.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Free training vs paid workshops</h4><p>Entrepreneur Rick has tried it all — webinars, video series, the live stream launch formula, video series, and more — before he came up with his current program. Rick shares how you can add value to your workshops and turn them into a high-priced product. He shares how he started out by picking a topic out of his courses and deep-diving into it for 2 to 3 hours. Rick came up with a sales strategy where he offers a cheaper price for students registering early and a free recording of the workshop that they can review later.</p><p>With this formula, Rick has gained an impressive show-up rate of 60%. He also highlights how students are more likely to show up and engage more when they paid for the workshop. Because of this early success, Rick was able to grow his business through his students’ recommendations. In two weeks, he was able to earn 5 figures with just his online workshops and courses.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Pandemic-affected sales</h4><p>Rick retained the same strategy in his succeeding workshops, but because of the global pandemic, his sales were greatly affected. He, however, shares a few tactics in order to keep the sales going despite the current state of things. Rick had to lower his workshop rates and pledged to donate the earnings of his first workshop to a local organization that aims to feed people during the global crisis. There was a substantial decline in the number of registrations, but the show-up rate remarkably increased to 73 percent.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to structure and market your workshops</h4><p>Rick stresses the importance of structuring your workshop according to your audience and how there are different needs and formats in every platform. He also believes that engaging with your students is key to improving your programs.</p><p>Transparency is Rick’s greatest advice in hosting paid workshops. He believes that by being honest with your workshop content, you are delivering a ton of value to your product. This is the secret to getting more students interested. The offers, breakdown of topics and the benefits of learning them, and everything the students will or will not get out of the workshop should be defined prior to the workshop. It is also important to share tips only shared in the course and host a live Q&amp;A at the end of the training. Keep your content updated, even pandemic-appropriate to make sure your students get the best value for their money.</p><p>&nbsp;Rick’s low-cost workshops are supported by an e-mail marketing software called <strong>ConvertKit</strong>. With the help of online tools like this, he is able to send out follow-up emails, what he calls value emails that provide bite-sized information about the workshop host and the workshop, and reminder emails leading to the date of the workshop. He runs these along with ads and social media promotions 2.5 weeks before the scheduled workshop.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to get better at coaching</h4><p>Rick shares some tips at how he got better at preparing and delivering workshops.</p><p>After a series of live training, he has learned how making the teaching approach more “human” allows the students to relate more and absorb information better. One important thing to avoid is what he calls an <strong>Advice Trap</strong>, where the students can get overwhelmed with a lot of resources that don’t necessarily help. Rick emphasizes the importance of assessing the needs of the audience before structuring your workshops. Rick shares how his greatest advice on coaching is deeply rooted in his love for helping people in a way the he is able to.&nbsp;<br></p>",

He shares how his company with millions of subscribers operates as a tripod – with content-writing, business and tech focus, and internet marketing – and how other indie hackers can make a successful business out of the same formula.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The Art of Persuasion</h4><p>Good copy can go a long way. The Hustler has gained a million subscribers within the first month of launching and founder Sam Parr believes it’s all thanks to the power of good copy-writing. He explains the AIDA method in writing advertising copy – Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action – from the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Advertising-Secrets-Written-Word-Entrepreneurs/dp/1891686003\">Advertising Secrets of the Written Word by Joseph Sugarman</a>. Sam describes copy-writing as an everyday tool to persuade people, whether it’s selling stuff, hiring an employee, getting support for your causes, or even asking someone out. For founders, he also stresses the importance of practicing writing just like how you would practice any skill or hobby.</p><p><br></p><h4>The Importance of Pricing</h4><p>We discuss the pros and cons of ad-supported newsletters vs paid subscriptions and why companies should be charging upfront.</p><p>Advertising revenues are on the rise because of the growing reader traffic in a time of pandemic. Founder Sam, on the other hand, shares why ad-supported media companies can be at a disadvantage at any time. Running advertisements in your newsletter could mean having limited subjects to talk about, whereas paid subscriptions give room for a wider range of content.</p><p>Sam Parr stresses the importance of pricing valuable content and how donation drives don’t work for every business. You want to price your content right to attract the right customer that will stick with you in the long run. He also mentions how crucial lengthy sales pages are in acquiring a loyal audience despite the trend of minimalist short-form websites.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Following Sam’s examples for growth</h4><p>The founder shares how The Hustle has paved the way for the launch of their new paid newsletter subscription – Trends – and how easy it is to grow your business with a loyal audience. He tells us the story of how he was able to get Trends up and running by offering a pre-sale of a lifetime subscription to 500 targeted users, and then putting their names on the Thank You page of The Hustle.</p><p>Sam has started out the company by his bootstraps and only hired other staff after getting his first good customers. He suggests picking a small fast-growing niche, knowing your market, learning from other business owners, and sharing your valuable knowledge with them too. We believe it is the golden era to start a business out of information that will help other people grow their businesses too.&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>It took 34 rejections and Linda Rottenberg for Wences Casares to break through</h4><p>After dropping out of college, dreaming up a long list of good ideas, and receiving dozens of rejections, Wences met Linda (whom he thought was part of a religious cult). Linda was seeking to start a revolution herself, by bringing entrepreneurs together with local investors.Through her contacts, Wences was able to raise capital from Fred Wilson of Flatiron Partners and Chase Capital. The young entrepreneur learned the language of local finance, changed his approach with investors, and was able to buy Patagon from Santander Bank for $750 million in 2000. He followed that up with a series of other start-ups.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Buying Bitcoin from “Gandalf” to save the legendary road trip</h4><p></p><p>After Wences had to cancel his yearly road trip across continents because his tour bus broke down, he tried to send money from California back home to Argentina to fix it. This proved impossible - until his friend introduced him to Bitcoin, a completely new concept for him in 2011. Even though he was skeptical, he bought $2000 worth of Bitcoin from a Gandalf look-alike in Palo Alto, certain he’d been scammed. But a miracle happened: he was able to send Bitcoins home, save the tour bus, and his road trip. This is when Wences first sensed the revolution of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Hiring hackers to break Bitcoin</h4><p>Wences hired hackers to see if they could crack the Bitcoin code but Bitcoins’ decentralisation makes it super secure. After the hackers themselves asked to be paid in Bitcoin, there was no turning back for Wences.</p><p><em>“I said, you know what, I want to dedicate the rest of my career, my reputation, and my capital to help this system succeed.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Why growing up in Argentina was important for Wences to succeed</h4><p>The US dollar is a stable currency and people think little about changing it. In Argentina, however, the government and currency are not as stable or reliable, and might one day just disappear. Wences knew Bitcoin was not an alternative but a revolution for Argentina.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Building underground vaults to secure XAPO</h4><p>Wences founded XAPO with Frederico Murrone to make Bitcoin more trustworthy. People started bringing Bitcoin to the two founders while the price was increasing rapidly.</p><p>Wences built underground vaults protected by armed guards to set up secure computer servers, and thus the Fort Knox of Bitcoin was created, reassuring people about the safety of their Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The Bitcoin Revolution of 2014</h4><p>Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin Exchange at the time, went bankrupt. This was a big setback as well as an awakening for crypto security. Bitcoin now sees more than 400,000 transactions per day in XAPO.</p><p>The early adopters of any digital tool have a lot in common, whether they are from Bangalore, Istanbul, or Palo Alto. The first billion users are easy to get, but the second billion struggle as they are all different.</p><p>‍</p><h4>XAPO operates fully remotely with 275 people across 62 countries</h4><p>Having no geographical barriers helps find better employees.</p><p>The XAPO team went to Kenya to experience M-Pesa, a digital payment method similar to Bitcoin. People of all income classes in Kenya use M-Pesa, and it is seen by Kenyans as a secure way of sending and storing money.</p><p>Talking to people about M-pesa gave Wences insight on what people actually value about such alternative payment methods.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Is Bitcoin bound to fail or succeed?&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Wences envisions measuring the value of currencies with the value of Bitcoins in the future.</p><p></p><p>Establishing a global non-political value for money could break the monetary system free by creating a standard of value that cannot be devalued or censored.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><em>“If Bitcoin works, it may do for value for money what the internet did for information.”</em></p><p><br></p>",

Her greatest influences are a mix of both types of thinkers:&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul><li>Linda Wachner, CEO of the clothing manufacturer Warnaco was Angela’s first mentor. She was a very analytical thinker, highly left-brained.</li><li>Donna Karan is the epitome of right-brained.&nbsp;</li><li>Paul Charron, Chairman and CEO of the multibillion-dollar clothing label Liz Claiborne, taught Angela how to connect with people.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>An unbreakable team at Liz Claiborne</h4><p></p><p>Angela and Paul acquired businesses together, and took <a href=\"https://www.juicycouture.com/\">Juicy Couture</a> from $50 million to a billion dollar company. Many private equity companies who acquire businesses don’t speak the same language as the founders of the company, but Angela looks at acquisitions as a team building exercise.</p><p></p><p><em>“It’s on you to see how the acquisition contributes to your elevated mission, and then unite this new team under it. And that turns out to be one of Angela’s superpowers.” </em>- Reid Hoffman</p><p><br></p><h4>The key to building relationships in business</h4><p></p><p>Look somebody in the eyes and really hear them out. Do not think of the next question. Building a human-to-human connection builds trust, and trust enables smoother acquisitions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>How Angela attracted a call from Burberry</h4><p></p><p>After seven years at Liz Claiborne, Angela got a call from British luxury brand Burberry. She was offered to become CEO, and turned the offer down. But then she met lead designer Christopher Bailey, and on a napkin they drew out a strategy for Burberry. She took the job and became in charge of 11,000 people.</p><p><br></p><h4>How Angela brought back the iconic “Burberry check”&nbsp;</h4><p></p><p>Angela needed to clean up the brand, elevate it, and make it more innovative. She wanted to bring back the “Britishness” of Burberry, establishing the “One Factor” from which all other factors flow. The<a href=\"https://www.burberryplc.com/en/responsibility/burberry-foundation.html\"> Burberry Foundation</a> was born through Angela, and became a guiding mission to reunite the whole team.</p><p></p><p>She presented her new strategy during a meeting with 200 top Burberry executives from around the world. She saw some skeptical faces, and reading everyone’s body language, she knew who was on board and who was not.</p><p></p><p><em>“I’m not looking to hurt anybody,” she said, “but you need to walk out of here 100% believing in everything we’re doing – or I don’t want you on the team and I will take care of you. But we can’t afford it. We have no time.”</em></p><p></p><p>Burberry started increasing sales by double digits six months after that meeting. Quick wins were important and motivating for the team. Angela did what her parents taught her to do: celebrate. There was a huge celebration in the Burberry theater.</p><p><br></p><h4>What makes Angela such a successful leader?</h4><p></p><p>She embraces a culture of celebrating and feeling good about quick wins. She also says that love was a key at Burberry, and that all 11,000 employees felt loved.</p><p></p><p>Angela started making quarterly videos to celebrate departmental achievements, trying to get the analysts’ and investors’ attention away from the numbers to make them focus on the bigger picture.</p><p><br></p><h4>Finally, the call from Apple came</h4><p></p><p>She quickly said no, but as she did not want to seem disrespectful, Angela ended up having a coffee with Tim Cook. She turned him down after their meeting, but eventually gave in. She hated her first few months at Apple...</p><p><br></p>",

They don’t invest in physical brands because these require a lot of capital, which doesn’t align with their fund.</p><p>Hustle Fund tries to go in very early and make quick decisions. 50<strong>%</strong> of the time they are the very first VC to check in or be in the first round. Once they get to the call stage, they usually make a decision within 48 hours.</p><p>The companies that they invest in must be able to monetize right away. Business models that match this are B2Bs like SAAS, and annual contracts because their margins are great.</p><p>Hustle Fund does not invest in companies in the ideas stage. They want to see something built. Yin’s top founder persona is someone that is frugal, scrappy, and a high velocity executor.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are the benefits of getting funding from Hustle Fund?</h4><ul><li>Their community of founders is made up of smart, active and engaged people who support each other through advice, connections, and introductions.</li><li>Besides the cheque, they will help you with introductions, and in some cases have done up to 30 introductions.</li><li>They will help you hone your pitch deck and outbound emails.</li><li>They carry out workshops for all their founders continuously throughout the year.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>How to get investment for your start-up</h4><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Cold email, and make sure it’s not a blanket email.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Introductions: find the best company that your target angel investor has invested in. Get someone from that company on your side, and have them introduce you to their angel investor.</li><li>Do both simultaneously.</li><li>Pitch by applying directly on their<a href=\"https://hustlefund.typeform.com/to/UGTnIt\"> website</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>For new angels, what’s the smallest acceptable cheque? And if you can’t write 25K, should one stick to syndicates?</h4><p>As long as they show that they’re not going to be a pain by calling all the time, and that they have additional value to offer such as fast decision-making skills and the ability to help with the pitch deck, then people will want to take them up. Angel investors can send a cold email to elizabeth@hustlefund.vc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>What is the most important feature that you look for in start-ups?</h4><p>Customer acquisition, customer acquisition, customer acquisition. They are less interested in traction and more focused on customer acquisition.</p><p>The start-up has to be able to show that there is a big problem, and that customers are making it a priority to find a solution.</p><p>The start-up also has to show that the solution is profitable. You may have high revenue but the cost to attract and acquire a customer may be high, meaning the margins are low. Hustle Fund wants to know how hard or easy it will be to get the customers, the market pull, and the length and speed of a sale cycle.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>What type of advice can you share with founders who are looking to raise now, knowing we’re in the middle of a global pandemic?</h4><ul><li>Angel investors and micro-investors are still active, and can write cheques over Zoom.</li><li>Much larger rounds will be challenging to secure.</li><li>Wait until we are through with this Covid-19 crisis, but you can prepare materials, get intros to line-up meetings now.</li><li>If you’re in a cash crunch, try to raise 200k.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>The future of Hustle Fund</h4><ul><li>Support other start-ups besides Silicon Valley software start-ups.</li><li>The mission is to make sure that hustlers who can really focus and execute with velocity should be able to get access to resources and funding. In the next 30/ 40 years, they could be launching other funds that tackle this problem in other ways.</li></ul><p>‍</p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Are you going insane during COVID-19?</h4><p>Keith Rabois, a real introvert, and Jason Calacanis, a full-on extrovert, are both losing their minds during isolation. Remote board meetings and start-up pitches are difficult, and six hours a day on Zoom is too much.</p><p><em>“Zoom removes all passion or nuance from a discussion”.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Will COVID-19 have a lasting impact on entrepreneurs, investors and Silicon Valley?</h4><p>Keith compares the situation to 2000-2003, which was a good time for Silicon Valley. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sqlbi/\">Marco Russo</a> predicted an entire economy based on technology and software in the 2000s. Since this has happened, everything that affects the global economy affects Silicon Valley.</p><p>Many were convinced there wouldn’t be another tech wave after the financial crisis of 2008, but the “unmanageable, confrontational misfits, usually immigrants,” of Silicon Valley proved the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p>These “kids” of Silicon valley have now grown up, and have very different opinions from politicians and the media. The media fails to consider any position that is not anti-Trump, and in general, people don’t tend to accept new ideas that disagree with their current paradigms.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How amateurs can triumph over experts</h4><p>A fresh pair of eyes brings in new perspectives that experts may be blind to.</p><p>Of the 254 Bay Area people who worked at PayPal, for example, only three had a finance-related degree. The same ratio of experts vs amateurs was the case at Square.</p><p>Keith’s key to success: Find a very fragmented industry that has poor customer satisfaction and figure out how to improve it with an end-to end solution.</p><p>Employ first principle thinkers: people who apply logic to a set of problems by asking a series of why questions.</p><p><br></p><h4>How dependent are we on China?</h4><p>The US became friendly with China during the Cold War because of the threat of the USSR. After the fall of the Soviet Union, no one asked why China was still an alliance. Exposing China to a free market system should have broken their authoritarian system. It did not.</p><p>Keith and Jason both agree with Trump’s critical attitude towards China, as the country poses a threat to US Intellectual property.</p><p>The economic principle of comparative advantage regarding manufacturing in China does not take into consideration a strategic dimension. Vulnerabilities have been created by outsourcing production of drug production, for example. Fentanyl is made in Wuhan, and therefore China is indirectly responsible for these drug-related deaths in the US. Jason Calacanis would like to invoice China for all fentanyl-related deaths.</p><p>China experimented with strains of COVID in Wuhan. On the other hand, China basically jails, murders or expels anyone who is now trying to research the virus.</p><p><br></p><h4>Censorship, free speech, and how countries are disengaging</h4><p>Now, Japan is subsidizing the movement of their companies out of China, and Keith believes other countries, like the US, will follow Japan's lead and move manufacturing out of China.</p><p>Taiwan is to be embedded into the World Health Organisation to strategically drive China insane.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryl-warren-b5a71136/\">Daryl Morey</a> gets ridiculed in the US for supporting the protests in Hong Kong. US companies should be able to express their points of view in China and vice versa.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/senatorelizabethwarren/\">Elizabeth Warren</a> also criticizes China. <em>“The left has totally sold out their position on human rights.”</em></p><p><a href=\"https://joebiden.com/\">Joe Biden</a>, on the other hand, has earned the nickname <a href=\"https://beijingbiden.com/\">Beijing Biden</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Why is the stock market bouncing back so quickly with record-setting unemployment numbers?</h4><p>The stock market is defending the old corporate finance theory: You value a public equity by the discounted cash flows over 20 years+.</p><p>There is an acceleration and transformation of technology usage in various industries because of the crisis, and Keith predicts that there might be another significant market correction.</p><p>Some companies are having their best months in the stock market during COVID-19.</p><p><br></p><h4>Going public</h4><p>Keith advocates companies to go public as early as possible, as this allows access to debt and equity that private companies don’t have. Also, market value is more accurate when public, and the stock price gives a great overview of performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Growth-Handbook-Elad-Gil/dp/1732265100\">High Growth Handbook</a> is a great guide for going public.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>20% unemployment on start-ups vs mental impact of social isolation</h4><p>The COVID-19 impact is more catastrophic from a healthcare perspective, than an economic one.</p><p>People's psychological happiness is derived from meaningful work, so giving people a (UBI) cheque to survive will not work. Humans need to create. There is a huge lack of empathy from privileged people for those who cannot put food on the table anymore.</p><p>Suicides are up 50% in Australia.</p><p><br></p><h4>Keith still has a positive outlook&nbsp;</h4><p>There are opportunities for innovation and it’s easier to break through with new ideas.</p><p>Homeschooling will rise, and homeschooled children will outperform others.</p><p>Telemedicine is improving, and will keep improving.</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Introduction to Wavebreak</h4><p></p><p>Dylan Kelley founded Wavebreak in 2016 with the hopes of eventually getting to work with influential brands on social media platforms. After noticing the unreliability of Facebook ads, Dylan began experimenting and stumbled upon the power of email advertising.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Dylan says email can maximize lifetime value and increase repeat orders from customers more reliably than social media advertisements. Hence Wavebreak has been focused on harnessing its power to help their clients double, even triple their revenue. Anyone interested in Wavebreak’s services can <a href=\"https://wavebreak.co/call\">reach out to Dylan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>The origins of the State Bicycle Company (SBC)</h4><p></p><p>Brothers Mehdi and Reza Farsi have always been passionate about cycling. In 2009, they started the <a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.com/\">State Bicycle Company</a> with the aim of making bike customization more cost-effective and convenient.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Since then, they have released several bike series made from a variety of materials and for an assortment of purposes (competitive cycling, recreational cycling, daily commutes, etc.). On average, SBC sells approximately 20,000 custom bikes per year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>How SBC is handling COVID-19</h4><p></p><p>Due to the current pandemic, the SBC has seen an increase in demand. In view of the crisis, they have decided to change their messaging for clients with an emphasis on cycling safely. For example, they advise customers against cycling in groups, and to always wear proper safety equipment so as to avoid accidents and unnecessary trips to the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>How SBC landed unique collaborations</h4><p></p><p>Collaboration opportunities can arise in the following ways:</p><ol><li>Organically (that is, being at the right place at the right time)</li><li>Being approached by potential collaborators</li><li>“Chasing down” potential collaborators and pitching an idea to them</li></ol><p></p><p>SBC’s collaborations have allowed them to broaden their audience and provide their customer base with unique products. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.com/blogs/news/the-simpsons-x-state-bicycle-co-dream-builds\">“The Simpsons” cycle</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.com/blogs/retired-models/froot-loops-x-state-bicycle-co-collab\">“Froot Loops” cycle</a>.</p><p></p><p>Mehdi Farsi believes that since SBC is relatively young and comparatively smaller than other well-established brands (like Giant or Trek), it can pivot easily and take advantage of unique collaboration opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Mehdi also looked at how smaller companies in other industries operated and brought those lessons to the bike manufacturing industry.</p><p><br></p><h4>Alternative sources of revenue</h4><p></p><p>In addition to selling custom bikes, SBC also sells merchandise such as cycling jerseys, hats, and shirts along with accessories which people tend to replace periodically, like helmets, locks, and lights. Customers also need to change bicycle parts due to wear-and-tear, or simply because they want an upgrade or a new aesthetic. So SBC ensures that it offers those products as well.</p><p></p><p>In order to maximize lifetime value from customers and keep them coming back for more, SBC thinks of more than just the present. It visualizes what customers are thinking even long after they have purchased their first SBC bicycle.</p><p><em>“We think of ourselves as… a gateway into the world of cycling.” </em>- Mehdi Farsi</p><p></p><p>As a result, SBC prioritizes durability of their bikes, which keeps customers satisfied and encourages them to return. From personal experience, Mehdi also knows his customers will keep experimenting with different kinds of riding experiences (off-roading, geared bikes, etc.), so SBC has developed several different bike series for returning customers to explore.</p><p></p><p>SBC also maintains an active presence on their social media channels (Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/statebicycleco/?hl=en\">@statebicycleco</a> &amp; Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/statebicycleco?lang=en\">@StateBicycleCo</a>) and has even launched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/statebicycle/videos\">YouTube series</a> which brings them closer to their customers while also driving income. The final technique SBC uses involves limited edition jersey runs and annual promotions to excite customers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Shopify launches a new app<br></h4><p>Patrick welcomed Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke to the podcast and mentioned him as one of the great builders Patrick aspires to be, along with Daniel Ek and Jeff Lawson, two other previous guests on his podcast.</p><p>Tobi talked about Shopify’s new app called Shop. This app is designed to help consumers find local and independent brands in an age of online shopping.Tobi is highly focused on details and spends a lot of time with product development, and notes that a lot goes into a product’s quality.</p><p><em>“It’s everything from the frame rate of animation, to the copywriting, to the precision of illustration, all the way down to the architecture.”</em> - Tobi Lutke</p><p>Patrick cited a previous guest on his podcast, Bill Gurley, who has famously said that you need to get collected demand to be able to sell in a marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Tobi emphasized that Shop doesn’t seek to be a traditional marketplace; it’s a place to discover merchants and new brands to follow, based on whoever consumers have already purchased products from.</p><p><br></p><h4>Company processes have to go</h4><p>Tobi said it’s important for employees to focus their brainpower on the task at hand, instead of following workplace rules by the book.</p><p>Changing employees’ behaviour should be done by making it easier for them to do so. One example Tobi shared was when Shopify wanted their employees to return lunch trays. This was made easier by having lunch tray racks placed near the lunchroom exits.</p><p><em>“We avoid processes as much as possible.”</em> – Tobi Lutke</p><p>Patrick O’Shaughnessy read the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Bible-Beginners-Guide-Large/dp/0961825170/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=podcastnote0c-20&linkId=37b6c58b0c0533e9b554ad86dfdcfe85&language=en_US\">The Systems Bible</a> by John Gall, and learned that a company is better off with fewer systems in place. Rather, it’s good to trust employees to do the right thing.</p><p><br></p><h4>Communication and personality are key</h4><p>Tobi pointed out that Shopify makes communication with employees a priority. He does this with an internal corporate podcast, which he rolls out weekly. In each podcast, Tobi shares the internal decisions being made, and their results.</p><p>Tobi believes that personality testing does play a productive role within a company, but feels that it is misused in other companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The primary - and most important - takeaway from personality testing is that people are different. Each person has a different point of view of the world around them.</p><p><br></p><h4>Video games are good for us!</h4><p>Patrick remarked in the podcast that, growing up, he played a lot of Starcraft and Warcraft, and other real-time strategy games. He asked Tobi what these games can teach us about real life, including business.</p><p>In response, Tobi said that<em> “it feels impossible to say that spending a lot of time in your formative years with something doesn’t somehow shape you in your future.”</em></p><p>The same skills used in a game - playing one race and interacting with others and handling an in-game economy - can be used in running a business, where you transfer talent from one area to another, and make strategic decisions.</p><p>To learn more about this philosophy, Tobi recommends the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Code-Greatness-Born-Grown/dp/055380684X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=podcastnote0c-20&linkId=b71d56e400e742b23873b8a88e6ee34c&language=en_US\">The Talent Code</a> by Daniel Coyle.</p><p>However, the most important takeaway from playing real-time strategy games is whether or not the player is able to pay enough attention to manage everything.<br><br></p><h4>Stoicism and us<strong><br></strong></h4><p>Tobi enjoyed reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=sl1&tag=podcastnote0c-20&linkId=bc976dffce754026efc2352176e5c061&language=en_US\">A Guide to the Good Life</a> by William B. Irvine, a book about the philosophy of stoicism.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than focus on religion, the book provides a focus on living a good life. The key point that the book makes is to focus on influencing things that are under your control, including yourself.<br><br>As an example, Tobi said you don’t have to feel insulted by something another person says about you. In order to be offended, you’d have to accept the insult.</p><p><br></p>",
      "Curious": "<p>Tobi recommends reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E257T6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=podcastnote0c-20&linkId=ad97f8d7a4f9796d6eb202533321f4da&language=en_US\">The Design of Everyday Things</a> by Donald A.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Challenges lead to healing<br></h4><p>Boyd Varty grew up in South Africa, where his father and uncle were lion hunters. They restored a bare plot of land and turned it into a grassland where people could go on safaris. This inspired Boyd’s philosophy about how people are like land.</p><p>‍<em>“Land that is traumatized cannot absorb the rainfall, just like a person who’s become traumatized in some way starts to be unavailable to what they actually need.” - Boyd Varty</em></p><p>The Varty Family was pummeled with lawsuits after the land was restored; this went on for ten years. To top it all off, Boyd was attacked by a crocodile and assaulted at gunpoint. At that time, he started to lose his faith in life, until he met a woman who helped him heal and get back on his feet. Boyd has learned that you can heal yourself by finding what you’re passionate about and sharing it with everyone else.</p><h4>‍<strong><br></strong>Develop track awareness<br></h4><p>Boyd says tracking is like life: you won’t always know where to go, but you can get clues and make an educated guess on what to do. You have to teach yourself to see all the information there is, whether you’re tracking animals or pursuing some other passion.</p><p><em>“Slowly you have to teach yourself to see your track. You have to start tuning into something very specific to you and no one can tell you what your track will be, that is just going to come out of attention.” - Boyd Varty</em></p><p>Boyd encourages developing “track awareness\" that is, noticing the things you are curious about and that make you forget about time. Pursuing our big vision takes several tiny steps. Sometimes, we have to determine what’s the next small step we can take that brings us closer to where we want to go. And sometimes, we get lost.<br>Getting back on track involves self reflection and trying new things. What were you doing last time you felt like you were on the right track? What different things can you do that can help you get back on track? What should you avoid doing, in order to stay on track? Tracking encourages us to step outside of our comfort zone, yet be more realistic about our goals.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>Tracking teaches us about body language<br></h4><p>Of all people, Boyd knows that lions can be very dangerous, and should be approached with caution. They can be most dangerous when they are defending cubs or eating.</p><p>Lions use their body language to communicate their hostility to anyone who comes too close to them; stood up, hunched over, teeth snarled, tail lashing. Boyd says you can fend off an angry lion’s charge by standing your ground and shouting at it; there is a 99% chance of the lion stopping and running away.</p><p><em>“You have to let that lion know, with absolute certainty, that you are dangerous. [...] It teaches you how to communicate without words.“ - Boyd Varty</em></p><p>The same can be said about human body language. Someone’s eyes, posture, and tone of voice can tell us a lot about how they feel. “We can sit down and we can talk, but the real conversation that’s happening between us is the feeling between us.” &nbsp;Boyd notes that it can be easier for people who have had traumatic childhoods to track animals because they have become more naturally capable of reading into certain cues that signal incoming danger.<br></p><h4><br></h4><h4>Early mortality checks are “initiations”<br></h4><p><em>“I look at all of the things that happened to me [in the past] as initiations.” - Boyd Varty</em></p><p>Boyd recalled the incident where he was tied up and threatened at gunpoint and another time when he got bitten by a crocodile. Such an early check on mortality can increase your desire to love others; and that's exactly what it did for them. As we heal ourselves, we become more connected to nature and learn to prioritize giving over taking.</p><p>“The restoration of the planet will come out of a shift in human consciousness” - Boyd Varty<br></p>",
      "Curious": "<p>Aubrey Marcus highly recommends Boyd’s new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Trackers-Guide-Life/dp/0358099773/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=sl1&tag=podcastnote0c-20&linkId=711ad43152ceb1fd8b56298e55abce59&language=en_US\">The Lion Tracker’s Guide to Life</a>.<br>Another recommendation is Boyd’s new podcast, <a href=\"https://boydvarty.com/about/40-days-40-nights/\">40 Days 40 Nights</a>, a day-by-day retelling of his 40-day experience in solitude in the South African wilderness.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>From rags to riches, then rags again</h4><p>In the 1990s, James Altucher founded Reset, a web design company that designed websites for the entertainment industry. After a few years, he sold Reset for $15 million. He started a venture capital firm in 1999 and raised $200 million. He also eventually bought himself an apartment in New York City, made various investments and bought stocks.</p><p></p><p>“I just didn’t know what I was doing.” - James Altucher</p><p></p><p>Altucher claims that he was losing $1 million per week in 2000 because he did not understand risk or money management. By mid-2001, he went to zero and desperately tried to sell his apartment - when the World Trade Center was attacked and the stock market became more volatile as a result.</p><p></p><p>There are other times when Altucher made millions and lost everything again. He recalls building a social media website, which he describes as “MySpace of finance,” and later selling it for $10 million.</p><p></p><p>“And then a year later, I was broke again.

I would have my software find statistically significant patterns where trades were good. So I would try to model, say, fear and greed in the markets, and it worked pretty well.” - James Altucher</p><p></p><p>This strategy worked because there weren’t as many quantitative investors in the market at that time. This gave Altucher time to learn about investing and talk to expert investors.</p><p></p><p>“I am the worst idiot in the world. [...] What I mean by that is, I didn’t have to do any work once I invested because Peter Thiel was an investor.” - James Altucher</p><p><br></p><h4>The science behind the sale</h4><p></p><p>Altucher pointed out that selling a company requires skills: first with starting a company, then building it and selling it.</p><p></p><p>Part of the experience involves meeting people, then there is what Altucher describes as a “courtship.” Then, when the relationship kicks into full gear, there is a “due diligence” period when the selling comes next. It is also important to be able to get along with your employees.</p><p></p><p>“You have to have a vision that matches their vision very strongly and it has to explain [...] if your business is so great, why would you want to sell it?” - James Altucher</p><p></p><p>Negotiation skills are an absolute must. With multiple formulas used for valuing a company, it’s crucial to understand the variables of a formula enough when negotiating with potential buyers.</p><p><br></p><h4>The importance of self-care</h4><p></p><p>Every single time he lost everything, Altucher faced depression and was suicidal. Over time, this taught him that it’s important to maintain good physical, emotional, spiritual and creative health.</p><ul><li>Physical health: Are you getting enough to eat? Enough sleep? Enough fresh air?</li><li>Emotional health: Are you surrounding yourself with good people?</li><li>Spiritual health: Are you trying to control stuff out of your control?</li><li>Creative health: Are you a fountain of new ideas?</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>The idea writing process</h4><p></p><p>Altucher has developed a routine of formulating and writing down ten ideas to himself every day, which has rewired his brain to be more creative and pitch good ideas to other companies.</p><p></p><p>He’s come up with a process called “idea sex,” where you take ideas from two different industries and combine them into an “idea baby” that could work. As an example, Altucher talks about monetizing a good meal at a restaurant as well as the good behaviour of a waitress. With servers being at the bottom third of the food industry, how can that bottom third be lightened up to make more money?</p><p></p><p>Finally, some key advice Altucher has for making money is to enter the marketplace with a unique perspective, and offer content that is worth paying for.</p><p></p><p>“When I write something, I don’t hit ‘Publish’ unless I’m afraid of what people will think about me after I hit ‘Publish,’ because otherwise then I’m probably not saying something new or different. [...] I have to challenge myself in some way to create new content.”&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>COVID-19 and the US economy</h4><p>The mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic response has led to over 30 million people being unemployed. Chamath Palihapitiya points out that many currently unemployed people will probably choose to not return to the workforce after the lockdown lifts.</p><ul><li>“How many of the people that are leaving the workforce may never come back? That has a societal toll and a weight that we will all have to bear.” - Chamath Palihapitiya</li></ul><p>David Sacks estimates that it will take roughly two or three years for the economy to recover, unless another proportionally-large unforeseen crisis arises. It is misleading to look at the technology and software companies who are doing well in this pandemic and draw the conclusion that the economy is in recovery. The economy is, in fact, doing terribly despite government measures to keep it afloat.</p><p>Jason Calacanis predicts that if remote work was to continue after the lockdown is lifted, companies would be able to reach never-before-seen levels of efficiency and profitability. Working remotely allows managers to work closely with their teams, and replace the “bottom people” with talent and skills from anywhere in the world. Additionally, companies would no longer pay for large office spaces or fees to relocate their employees. Working remotely cuts out office politics and busywork, and frees up employees’ time, which would lead to positive impacts personally, professionally, and socially.</p><p><br></p><h4>Mass migration is likely imminent</h4><p>Cities like San Francisco rely on the network effects caused by Silicon Valley; i.e. if you want to be considered for a tech job position in a big player company, you would have to live and know people in San Francisco. If remote work persists, employees will be able to live wherever they want. And since big cities like San Francisco have such high tax rates and costs of living, those employees would likely move elsewhere.</p><p>Furthermore, if the COVID-19 spread persists, high-risk populations (older people, those who are immunocompromised, etc.) will likely also choose to move away from cities.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Politicization of the way forward</h4><p>Chamath is frustrated that even though dealing with the pandemic should have been relatively straightforward, it has been transformed into a Left vs. Right issue, which is now culminating in mask-wearers trying to prolong the lockdown while those who are anti-masks are pushing to end it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“There just doesn’t seem to be enough political wherewithal and courage to… do the right thing, independent of what your political persuasion is.” </em>- Chamath Palihapitiya</p><p>Sacks believes the “right thing” would involve safely reopening the country under proper health and safety requirements, like wearing masks, social distancing, etc. However, with governors unable to get on the same page, that possibility seems unlikely right now. Furthermore, the unwillingness to end the lockdown may overshadow the discussion around the incompetent response to the pandemic, and could very well lead to Trump’s re-election come November 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of accurate and reliable knowledge regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against the SARS-Cov-2 virus leaves a lot of room for debate and politicization.</p><p><em>\"When there’s a lot of room for debate, you usually revert to some kind of base belief or base political point of view.” </em>- David Friedberg</p><p><br></p><h4>The modern Cold War: US vs. China</h4><p>Due to numerous strategic investments over the last few decades, China has come close to usurping the United States’ position as a world leader.</p><p><em>“China is a much more worthy adversary for [the USA] than the USSR was at their peak.”</em> - Chamath Palihapitiya</p><p>Trade creates wealth, but it also creates interdependence. So although it would be impractical to completely cut off ties with China, the US should not be dependent on it for essential equipment for survival, such as PPE and ventilators. David Sacks is concerned that the decoupling from China will also become a bi-partisan issue, when the real focus should be on establishing a better trade balance and reciprocity.</p><p>Friedberg predicts that unless the US decides to revolutionize the production process, there is simply no way to replace China as a manufacturer without the cost of everything going up five-fold. However, if the US were to reinvent production, it could go on to replace China as the world manufacturer.&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>COVID-19 as a changemaker</h4><p>The world has stood still because of the global pandemic, causing lasting changes on the economy. Naval Ravikant points out how we are collectively adapting to this rapid shift: ordering everything online, working from home, and some even losing their livelihood and having to reinvent themselves.</p><p>New Zealand is slowly becoming one of the most attractive green zones because of how it has handled the pandemic, with no new recorded cases as of the time of this writing. Naval highlights the significant factors that may have contributed to New Zealand’s success – its geography and the fact that the majority of its workforce are remote workers.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>The rise of digital&nbsp;</h4><p>The lockdown imposed in every part of the globe has drastically affected the economy, and it cannot stay this way because of the possibility of economic collapse. This is why Naval urges businesses to make the shift to digital. Industries like tourism and infrastructures are most likely to suffer. He shares how the new normal is turning our lifestyle “from gray to green” – from urban to nature, and how it also shapes the new needs of the market. As a result, companies offering digital goods are doing great despite difficult times.</p><p>‍</p><h4>A collective test&nbsp;</h4><p>Naval believes this a collective test – a single problem to be solved collectively. He demonstrates the need for the government and private sector to work together for the economy to survive this pandemic, which may go on for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Entrepreneurs are the most affected and need the most assistance, now more than ever. Naval shares a strategy the government can adopt – partnering with organizations like Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) in implementing immigration programs that will strengthen the country’s workforce and create a new hot spot for tech start-ups just like Silicon Valley. According to Naval, companies should train workers to be digitally literate and incentives must be given to those who undergo training. For countries like New Zealand, he suggests finding the best and the brightest from different parts of the world and issuing work visas for them. He also recommends bringing in investors with the highest qualifications and urging them to fund the digital literacy programs for students.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>How investors can help rebuild the economy</h4><p>Now that people are using a lot more technology from their homes, more people are seeing value in them and are therefore investing in tech. Being forced to work remotely has given investors more access to talents.&nbsp;</p><p>For investors, Naval suggests investing in one great cause instead of little investments – one that is economy-focused and can bring in passionate changemakers. Start-ups should have a local-driven collaborator that can provide knowledge and resources for them too.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Advice for start-ups&nbsp;</h4><p>Podcast host Yoseph presents the challenge founders are facing today – not having the smart capital for rapid growth. Naval proposes the solution of training their talents to become more digitally literate, which can attract more investors. Accelerating the shift to digital economy is the way.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Investors follow the talent. If you can pull in the talent, the money will follow.” -</em> Naval Ravikant&nbsp;</p><p>For start-ups, he thinks now is the perfect time to take a leap of faith. If they see great potential, venture capitalists will want to invest in your company before it even launches. Now that everything is done online, remote investing has become the norm, which means more possibilities awaiting your business.&nbsp;</p><p>For businesses needing a global market, Nadal recommends riding the wave of digital export. “<em>Think of anything digital that you can scale globally</em>,” he adds. He also suggests investing in cryptocurrency, comparing it to the struggle of every immigrant who takes the same risk when they start over in a different country.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the time to take as much risk as you can to increase market share, recruit the best talent, invest in digital products, and acquire customers who are eager to try anything new from their homes. According to Naval, there is no such thing as being lucky, so we should all just make luck work for us.&nbsp;<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The connection between minds and bodies</h4><p></p><p>Dr. Joe Dispenza’s research is dedicated to proving that we are <em>not</em> doomed by our genes or our past. His neuroscientific research has found evidence of the positive impacts of spirituality, elevated emotions, etc., on personal development and physical health.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Dispenza has found that sustaining elevated emotions for 10-15 minutes a day, twice a day, four times a week increases immunoglobulin A, which is a primary defense against viruses. This then leads to upregulated T-cells and the activation of B cells.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>For this reason, he started the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrJoeDispenzaOfficialNewsFanPage/posts/the-28-day-challenge-is-a-movement-of-thousands-of-people-who-are-united-in-crea/3008397689185605/\">GOLOV-20 movement</a>, which encourages participants to express their love (through calls, texts, voice recordings, etc.) on a daily basis. The aim is to motivate people to act out of love rather than out of fear and anxiety, because Dr. Dispenza’s research has shown that those strong negative emotions can have measurable effects on a person’s physical heart.</p><p><br></p><h4>Achieving transcendental experiences</h4><p></p><p>Dr. Dispenza has discovered that when people are in suggestive states and have trained their nervous systems to focus on a frequency, this can lead to super high levels of internally-generated nervous system arousals, which move energy to the brain. This state is more commonly known as “ecstasy” or “bliss”. Transcendental experiences involve broadening one’s spectrum of reality through becoming aware of our subconscious and how we have been ‘programmed’ through our personal experiences.</p><p>“We don’t see things how they are, we see things through how we are.” - Dr. Joe Dispenza</p><p></p><p>This phenomenon can be achieved by “dialing down” the neocortex so that most of the energy is in the autonomic nervous system, which then sends organized signals to cells and improves their communication and functions. Dr. Dispenza recounts an anecdote of a woman who restored her eyesight through this method after a stroke left her clinically blind. Having witnessed several similar cases before, he explains that he believes this was made possible by quantum biology. His aim is to use these transcendental experiences to transform clients’ minds, bodies, and lives.</p><p></p><p>However, Dr. Dispenza admits that he is still learning about this method. He does not mean that his techniques will work for everyone. He advises clients who see no positive effects after using his method for sometime to look into other practical changes and techniques they can use to improve their well-being and health. There is no “superior way” to achieving a transcendental experience. Whether it is through meditation, yoga, psychedelics, or anything else, achieving a transcendental experience is personal and subjective.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the method used, Dr. Dispenza reminds those seeking a transcendental experience to trust the process and not hold back. This could help an individual overcome past fears and experiences, and thus free them up to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Getting into a creative state</h4><p></p><p>Like many other authors, both Dr. Dispenza and Dave agree that it can often take some time to transition into “writing mode”. This is because the brain’s stress hormones need time to settle down. Like Dr. Dispenza, some writers do not need external stimulation to get into a creative state, but Dave has found that running minute gamma electrical currents through his temples has worked for him personally.<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The shift of power from platforms to talent</h4><p>Spencer opens this subject by making a correlation between his experience as a pro athlete and the crypto world. In every crypto transaction, there is a consumer, asset, and a broker, which is not much different from a sports transaction. If the consumers-fans believe that a player-the asset is good, they will invest their power and resources into them, and so will the brokers - teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By using this experience and knowledge, Spencer Dinwiddie created a new platform on the crypto blockchain <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/\">Ethereum</a> that gives fans the opportunity to invest directly in his revenue-generating potential: part of his NBA contract, through debt securities that bring revenue in the form of interest.</p><p>The whole <a href=\"https://globalx.ventures/\">Global X</a> platform allows passionate fans to be involved with a team or a player they like without having to own millions of dollars. It’s also a new, digital way of creating fan engagement and elevating it to another level, something that startups have been trying to do for years.</p><p><br></p><h4>How the NBA reacted to Spencer’s idea</h4><p>At first, the NBA was reluctant to allow this form of fan engagement, but over time they realized they needed this to survive, and warmed up to the idea. Spencer approached the NBA as a partner who wanted to create something that was cool for fans, and brought profit for all parties involved. Other players have also shown interest in this idea as it’s a great way to produce more liquidity for players while allowing fans to get closer to them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>New ways of investing in sports have always sparked interest</h4><p>When Jeff Jordan interviewed former professional football player Joe Montana years ago, Joe mentioned that, since he started, players have been interested in new ways of investing. However, the difference is that then it was car dealerships, cars, and stocks, whereas now the investing trends are shifting over to digital assets.</p><p><br></p><h4>Blending the passion for sport and fan engagement</h4><p>Social media has provided a whole new platform to engage with fans and allow them to show their support. Whether it’s by following a fan page or buying merchandise, fans can engage with players and teams, especially Gen Z-ers, the main target of this social media engagement trend.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Community-oriented products</h4><p>Here, Jesse Walden jumps in to share his thoughts about how he believes that, unlike other types of investment, crypto networks and blockchains are owned by the community, not individuals. Because of this, it allows a great mass of people to defend and focus on the same thing - a coin, which is not very different from Spencer’s platform where fans (the community) invest in him and his talent. By blending this idea with the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/\">Ethereum</a> crypto coin, Spencer has found a great blend of fan engagement, community ownership, and investing profit for everyone involved.</p><p><br></p><h4>Tokenization vs. Traditional shares</h4><p>One of the main reasons Spencer founded <a href=\"https://globalx.ventures/\">Global X </a>is to create a future where everything is tech-based, and to show everyone that this can, and will, go far. With the trading process and tech development going forward, it will be simpler to use tokens to trade.</p><p>People are also fractionalizing interest in different types of assets - cars, collectibles, artwork, etc. However, it’s still uncertain if these things will appreciate as people hope they will, and if they’ll bring the interest people invested for.</p><p><br></p><h4>Generating new ways of income streams</h4><p>Tokenizing is creating new platforms for exchanging and trading, which then creates new ways of generating profit for investors and traders. As with Spencer’s venture capital and private equity company and cryptocurrencies, the whole trading process offers a new exciting way for people to invest in something in return for a token (a fraction of ownership).&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Spencer shares his journey of how he started talking about an idea in which no one believed in, to today, when this idea has become a successful company in which his friends and colleagues want to invest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Fear and anxiety</h4><p>While fear is a necessary part of life and survival, it should not consume us.&nbsp;<em>“Fear is a gift… but it becomes a curse the moment you can’t let go of it.”</em> - Sam Harris</p><p>As humans, we tend to overestimate the impact a hypothetical future event will have on us. Oftentimes our worst fears are never even realized, so stressing over the worst-case scenario is often unwarranted. If the problem is solvable, solve it. But if it is out of your control, then worrying about it is not going to help.&nbsp;<em>“Why suffer twice?”</em> - Sam Harris </p><p>Mindfulness — that is, focusing on your thoughts and feelings — is a useful tool for letting go of anxiety.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Experimenting with psychedelics</h4><p>It is important to note that different substances can lead to vastly different experiences. And while Sam considers meditation invaluable, he also believes that the physiological effects of mushrooms can make a person aware of an <em>“unrecognizably different experience of consciousness.”</em> Sam’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKGddvmU0fA\">most recent mushroom experience</a> has served as a “helpful reference point” that has helped him analyze his own consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>Drugs like psilocybin, mushrooms, and LSD are generally physically safe and well-tolerated. However, substances like MDMA and ibogaine can lead to very serious complications, even death. More data and scientific research is needed before these compounds can be used or combined as a form of psychedelic therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>For people looking to experiment with psychedelics, Tim Ferriss recommends keeping the following points in mind:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The COVID-19 pandemic is <em>not</em> the time for inexperienced/new substance users to start experimenting, especially with hospitals currently being unsafe places to visit.</li><li>Be aware of the legality of the drugs you plan to take.&nbsp;</li><li>Have a “sitter” to supervise you during the session.</li><li>Don’t encourage others to start trying psychedelics unless you have had enough experience with them yourself.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Dealing with COVID-19</h4><p>Unfortunately, the breakdown in political conversations between the national leaders of the USA has hindered the country from dealing with the virus effectively. Under these conditions, there are different ethical considerations for essential workers and non-essential workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that you can accomplish so much even by just focusing on supporting the people in your life. Whether it is your closest friends or family members, or even someone peripheral — like your hairdresser — do your best to help.</p><p><em>“We should be looking for opportunities to help the people who are more vulnerable than we are.”</em> - Sam Harris</p><p>Even the gesture of reaching out to let people know that you are willing to help could act as a huge psychological and emotional boost for them. If you don’t have a framework to follow for your decisions or if you are struggling to find clarity under these stressful circumstances, don’t beat yourself up. Those feelings are not reflective of your personal shortcomings or your own lack of ability. Remember that those same feelings are being collectively experienced by millions of people everywhere.</p><p>Focus on the silver lining. This pandemic has shaken up our preconceived notions of the world and how we would like it to be. This is an opportunity to reevaluate our priorities. We must endeavor to maintain the insights we have gained from this pandemic even after life has returned to normal.<em> </em></p><p><em>“We have to keep an inventory of all the lessons being learned here and do better next time.”</em> - Sam Harris</p><p>‍</p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>How to hire people you can trust<strong><br></strong></h4><p>Start by looking for talent within your network. Ask existing CEOs that you know and trust for recommendations, and&nbsp; seek out people who can follow the same repeatable pattern they’ve used in other workplaces.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>Seek scrappiness. Does this potential colleague move things forward quickly, or do they get stuck in the mud and stay there? Look for people with a sense of urgency who love tangible results.</p><p>‍<strong><br></strong></p><h4>Why you should read up on Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger<strong><br></strong></h4><p>Some business owners never read about their industry (do the opposite!), and reading biographies can help you recognize the mistakes people have made along their business journeys, and how to avoid making these yourself.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>Charlie Munger uses a collection of rules and blueprints for problem solving which he calls<strong> </strong><em>“The Latticework of Mental Models.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>He employs two main strategies:<strong><br></strong></p><ol><li>The availability bias - &nbsp;a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision.</li><li>Incentive caused bias - the impact of incentives on changing human behavior and cognition, working as conscious and subconscious drivers for decisions.<strong><br></strong></li></ol><p>‍</p><h4>Growing companies is a much more repeatable process<strong><br></strong></h4><p>Growing a company is different than building one. There is much more repetition in business, in negotiations and pricing strategies for example .<strong><br></strong></p><p>‍</p><h4>Warning: Do NOT open a restaurant!&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></h4><p>It is wise to stick to the business that you know. Andrew Wilkinson's love for food inspired him to open a pizza restaurant in New York with a couple of friends. He failed spectacularly, which has really made him appreciate internet business. Brick and mortar companies are extremely difficult to build because they have low margins and cannot scale infinitely, like tech companies. Finding the right employees is also a challenge</p><p>‍</p><h4>Create powerful connections with people you want to work with<strong><br></strong></h4><p>Join discussion groups.Most entrepreneurs and investors have the same problems, which allows you to connect easily.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>A two-line cold email to billionaire Dan Gilbert was enough for Andrew Wilkinson to meet him.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<strong><br></strong></p><h4>Be a good person and treat people well<strong><br></strong></h4><p><em>“The best way to get a good spouse is to deserve a good spouse.”</em> - Charlie Munger<strong><br></strong></p><p>Only seek clients that offer the work you are willing to do for the long term. Helping start-ups become Fortune 500 companies landed Andrew Wilkinson Fortune 500 clients.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>Andrew Wilkinson’s biggest realizations&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></h4><p><em>“Fomo has calmed down a lot being a boring 35-year old dad.”</em> -Andrew Wilkinson<strong><br></strong></p><p>Andrew now looks at money as a tool to gain freedom to do the things he loves, and to protect those he loves.Travel is not a factor of happiness; routine and predictability is.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>‍</p><h4>‍<strong>What you should teach your kids about business<br></strong></h4><p>The Pareto principle (80/20 rule). In other words, 80% of the results you see come from 20% of the effort you put in.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>With enough practice, people can get to a good level of proficiency quickly.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>You must have direct business experience, and spreadsheet business is not enough. Don’t invest without having experienced business in the real world.<strong><br></strong></p><p>Investing in stocks with a 95% chance of failure is stupid.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p>Take bets in your 20s, but take bets with good odds.&nbsp;</p><p>If you manage to build a start-up that generates 100-200k in 2-4 years, you are set for life. <strong><br></strong></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Real estate is a religion</h4><p>When buying, plan on living there at least seven to ten years minimum, so that you can eat the costs of the transaction fees. We have been told that real estate is the best investment. “I don’t think it’s a bad investment always, but I always say you should run the numbers.” – Ramit Sethi.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>Invisible scripts and money dials</h4><p><em>“We all intuitively know that as you change in life, your spending is gonna change.” – Ramit Sethi.</em></p><p>These beliefs that run our lives are invisible scripts. Dan Kennedy said, “Why pay less when you can pay more?” Most people go through life looking through a frugality lens where everything is about cost.</p><p>There is a famous saying: “A fool and his money are soon separated.” There is a limit between the money you spend and the money you have.</p><p>Ramit, for one, is highly frugal. “I like having little places in my life where I intentionally impose scarcity. I think it’s healthy to have restraint to build that discipline.” Spend on things you love and cut costs on things you don’t love.</p><p>With a money dial, pick the area that you love spending money on, and 10x it. Money should be bifurcated – spending little on the things you do not like and going extravagant on the things you do.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>Negotiating</h4><p><em>“In life you don’t get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.” </em>– Tim Ferriss.&nbsp; Sometimes negotiating is just asking for what you want. Do not do it unless you are interested.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>Save and invest</h4><p>Save and invest at least 20-30% of your income. Pick a date you are going to retire and invest until then. Your money will double every seven years, and that’s why compounding is so powerful.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>Prenups</h4><p>Prenups sets the terms of what you are coming into a marriage with. It is an acknowledgement that certain people might have certain assets or interests, like a business. It also sets the terms for what happens if a marriage ends, and what is to be done with those assets. Negotiate in good faith.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>Ramit’s playbook for life</h4><ul><li>If you ever see a book you are even remotely interested in, buy it.</li><li>Have a year of cash available. If you do not have it, build up to it.</li><li>Save up for big expenses.</li><li>If anything looks good at a restaurant, just order it.</li><li>Have a couple of areas in your life for which you have absolutely no budget.</li><li>Eat the same thing mostly every single day.</li><li>Come up with some basic rules within your relationship together. Make a basic guideline so that you don’t have to think about it all the time.</li></ul><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>The disagreement</h4><p>Ramit thinks morning routines are overrated, and Tim disagrees. “Morning routines are one example of removing decisions.” It serves as a “boot up sequence<em>”</em> says Tim. Ramit thinks that tools are valuable. For Tim, on the other hand: <em>“</em>The tools are by-products of principles or strategies.” They approach problem solving differently, but their values and principles are similar.</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h4>The calendar</h4><p>If it’s not in your calendar, it’s not real. This includes issues in your relationships that need to be discussed, date nights, taking trips together, visiting each other’s families, etc. Tim and his girlfriend make time to discuss what they have been doing well/better, and where they feel they’ve dropped the ball or could focus on more.They take notes of their meeting and forward them to the other person.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The ritual itself may be even more important than the content.”</em> – Ramit Sethi.</p><p>There are times where they do not have stuff to talk about and push it back a week. But keep it in the calendar and opt-out for that week. Put everything into the calendar – call your parents, read a book, go to the gym.</p><p><em>&nbsp;“You decide, don’t let the world decide for you.”</em> – Ramit Sethi.</p><p>‍</p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The humble beginnings of Randy Hetrick</h4><p>Randy was a wrestler and kickboxer in high school, and got into jiu jitsu later on. He was then a navy SEAL for 14 years. During this time, he created his first product which became known as the TRX Suspension Trainer.</p><p>After leaving the SEALs he attended Stanford Business School, which he used as an incubator to develop his TRX concept. Since then, TRX has put about 350,000 people through their TRX coaching programs, and has 50,000 - 70,000 locations worldwide.</p><p>Randy follows <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbranson/\">Richard Branso</a>n‘s examples to grow his own brand, and cites <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocko-willink-260b289/\">Jocko Willick</a> and <a href=\"https://davidgoggins.com/about/\">David Goggins</a> as inspirations and role models.</p><p><br></p><h4>How well is TRX doing?</h4><p>For the first three years, Randy didn’t write himself any cheques. Now, TRX has a $30 million valuation, and is expecting to double. TRX has 100 full-time instructors and has become the business partner for fitness professionals worldwide. They are the largest provider of education for fitness trainers and education, now offering different 10 courses. The TRX Suspension trainer is the number one fitness item on Amazon.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Starting a high-end physical goods business</h4><p>Some of TRX’s customers are still using products from 2005, making it clear that creating premium products comes with a disadvantage: they last forever. Product based companies are undervalued because they do not have the potential to scale infinitely like tech companies. Selling a product in person brings in nearly 100% conversions, whereas selling online is close to 5% only.</p><p><br></p><h4>Attracting the pros to attract consumers</h4><p>A lot of consumers are attracted to TRX products because many professional trainers around the world are using them. Consumer branding has enabled TRX to extend their brand from B2B to B2C, and their products have been out of stock multiple times during the current COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>As the crisis hit, Randy realised TRX would struggle as most of the people doing their courses were now out of work, so he made the courses free, through Zoom.</p><p>This accelerated TRX massively, and they’re now going the digital route with an app as well. TRX is using the crisis to strengthen their relationship with existing customers, and to bring new customers in through free services.</p><p><br></p><h4>What Randy Hetrick enjoys most in business</h4><p><em>“I am an inventor.”</em>- Randy Hetrick</p><p>Product creation and content creation are Randy’s favorites, and he now avoids management activities within the company. He focuses more on leadership by promoting the brand, developing new products, and finding new initiatives. Leadership and management are two different skill sets, he says, and collaborators agree that Randy is a better leader than manager.</p><p><br></p><h4>Why angel investors are better&nbsp;</h4><p>Angels invest in businesses they understand, which makes them passionate about your business too.</p><p>Randy raised $5 million from angel investors and private equity. It’s the cheapest source of money, he says, as is non-dilutive capital, or any capital source that does not require equity in exchange.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The problem with institutional capital investors is they have not run businesses themselves, and try to implement ideas from business schools. They assume that people who operate a big company, who have a lot of certainty, and security know how to invest in new and different companies. There is a big difference between operating big and small companies.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Why Randy invests&nbsp;</h4><p>Randy is an angel investor both inside and outside the fitness market, with about 40 patents now. By investing as an equity investor, he invests in industries in which he feels he can make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>More companies are turning toward remote work as a long term change. </h4><p>For instance, Facebook recently announced that up to half of their 48,000 employee workforce would be moved to remote work. “I’ve been working from home full time for over a year. Apart from the fact I love what I do, it’s one of the main reasons why I love what I do because it gives you a lot of flexibility, and I genuinely cannot see myself doing a job out of choice where I would have to go to an office 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. It just doesn’t compute with me anymore.” - Yessi Bello Perez</p><p><br></p><h4>More opportunities for parents?</h4><p>Parents have particularly benefited from remote work. Check points toward statistics that say parents do around nine hours of child care per day.</p><p>“One of my hopes on the positive side coming out of the whole Covid pandemic is that [...] companies will realize that you can’t just hope that people who are parents can just figure it out. We have to actually provide more infrastructure and support, and financial support, to help people with such an important issue.” - Check Warner</p><p>Host Dan Murray-Serter pointed out that, in a global pandemic, companies are being forced to make unbiased decisions on which employees to keep and which ones to furlough or lay off, because they can’t necessarily afford to keep everyone on staff.</p><p><em>“It’s an unbelievably pressing thing to be trying to figure out in some respect.”</em> - Dan Murray-Serter</p><p><br></p><h4>Can we trust people to get the job done?</h4><p>Working from home has presented a variety of challenges toward those who are more accustomed to a traditional workplace setting. Some people have had spyware installed on their computers so that their supervisors can keep tabs on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Yess I argues that this implies that the employer doesn’t trust their staff to get their work done when they aren’t physically present.</p><p><em>“My whole premise throughout my career, ultimately [...] it comes down to, hire people that you can trust to do your job. At the end of the day, we’re all adults and it shouldn’t necessarily matter where you’re doing your job from as long as work’s getting done.” </em>- Yessi Bello Perez</p><p><br></p><h4>Mental health</h4><p>The pandemic has proven to be a difficult time to be a founder, with uncertainty and negative news creating major mental health problems.</p><p>A common expectation for founders is that they should be able to prove themselves to be able to handle difficult situations; this can cause some to not act like themselves and pretend that there is nothing wrong.</p><p><em>“At the end of the day...a founder is selling their vision and selling their capabilities to an investor that needs to believe that that founder has a lot of resilience, one way or another.”</em> - Dan Murray-Serter</p><p>Check argues that this is a great opportunity for founders to be honest about themselves and forge connections with other people who are going through the same situation.</p><p>“The founders that do share that authenticity and their true selves to us actually gives us more confidence that they’re not just there to give a positive spin on it and trying to be something that they’re not; they’re actually showing us the entire part of who they are as founders.”</p><p><br></p><h4>More opportunity for diversity?</h4><p>Yessi says that TNW’s editorial team makes it a point to put diversity at the forefront in everything they do.</p><p><em>“The more people that you speak to, the more different kinds of stories and different kinds of insight and different advice that you’re going to get.”</em></p><p>Yessi argues that women should be given opportunities to be founders and entrepreneurs; not just being confined to lower level roles like marketing and human resources.</p><p>Yessi and Check agree that, while the pandemic has affected everyone, it has turned out to be a positive development on diversity and collaboration.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of kindness to come out of this as well. I’ve picked up friendships that I [have not necessarily been paying a lot of attention to for several years, and people just reaching out and genuinely being concerned about how you are.” - Yessi Bello Perez<br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Can the Union Square Hospitality Group survive the coronavirus blow?</h4><p>Danny Meyer was forced to lay off over 2000 employees because of the lockdown, leaving only 75 members in his core team today. Although the restaurants owned by the USHG were quick to close, and the unfortunate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/dining/floyd-cardoz-dead-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">death of beloved Chef Floyd Cardoz</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic stopped everything, things are finally picking up, starting with<a href=\"https://www.ushgnyc.com/location/daily-provisions/\" target=\"_blank\"> Daily Provisions.</a> But each restaurant is different, and not all of them have economic agility. The USHG has some restaurants in museums, others in hotels, even airplanes, and designing a recovery plan for these is a far more complex problem.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ushgnyc.com/ushghugs/\" target=\"_blank\">USHG HUGS</a>, the employee relief fund, has been selling gift cards and conducting wine auctions, raising more than $1.4 million. $1.2 million of this money raised has already been granted out to former employees, helping many of them get back on track.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>What can you do to save your business?</h4><p>The USHG family is trying to support itself with the company now providing outreach services for jobs, learning, and connectivity to former employees. Danny and his team are working towards making sure they can welcome customers soon - from learning more about testing their staff in order to build more confidence in customers, to introducing perks like health passports. At times of crisis like this, collaboration between restaurants is key, and helping each other out is crucial. It is the time to adapt and innovate, leaving no stone unturned in the process as the industry’s very survival is on the line.&nbsp;</p><p>With the new restrictions forcing restaurants to run at 50% capacity, the only way to get through the preliminary phase is with a lean team. Restaurants rely heavily on beverage sales and the organization of private events for generating revenue, both of which have plummeted now. Nevertheless, many platforms like <a href=\"https://www.goldbelly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GoldBelly</a> are still making it possible for gourmet restaurants to ship their signature dishes across the country within 24 hours. Additions like these to conventional business models will probably stay long after the effects of the pandemic have worn-off. Providing hospitality has also become a lot more challenging now. With more rules to follow, the experience of hospitality will evolve as businesses begin to resume.</p><p>‍</p><h4>A great revelation for the hospitality industry</h4><p>Danny Meyer is a part of Governor Como’s reopening council for NY state, and co-chair for the coalition for NYC hospitality and tourism recovery. Restaurants must now learn to&nbsp; balance what’s good for their staff against what’s good for society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>“This virus has done a superb job of exposing a lot of the pre-existing conditions that our industry had.”</em>- Danny Meyer</p><p>The biggest structural issue facing this sector is its failure to create a stable living for the vast majority of employees. Most of Meyer’s discussions nowadays are based on reforming these pitfalls, linking to the ways people are paid, the tipping system, and also the structure of payroll taxes. Many liquor laws also tend to hold back restaurant operations, and then there’s the ever-looming problem of high rents. Current rent structures in big cities are based on expectations of a high volume of people due to high population density. Now, however, tenants need to have a dialogue with their landlords, with one solution being a shift from a fixed rent to a percentage rent. The state can also help by granting tax breaks for landlords that provide rent relief for restaurants.</p><p>Lawmakers rushed to create the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares\" target=\"_blank\">CARES Act</a>, which includes the PPP (payroll protection plan) program. In their haste, they made mistakes by inviting those businesses to apply for loans that didn’t need loans as much as others did. They also didn’t fund it adequately, and treated all businesses the same, which made recovery non-practical for many restaurants.&nbsp; Led by Danny Meyer’s ShakeShack, this resulted in a total $2 billion of return loans, exposing the program’s incompetence.</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>An age of all talk, no action</h4><p>In this episode of The Daily Stoic, Ryan Holiday states that we live in an age of increased virtue signaling, which is the expression of one’s beliefs in order to demonstrate good moral character. Although virtue signaling has been practiced for thousands of years, people are much better enabled to talk the good talk in an age of internet and social media. You get rewarded for the good talk, but not necessarily for the good deed based on that good talk.</p><p>Holiday quoted Theodore Roosevelt, who said in a 1915 speech at Oyster Bay, New York: <em>“I have a perfect horror of words that are not backed up by deeds.”</em> He also quoted ancient Roman philosopher and emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose words basically go against the grain of how people tend to behave on social media.<br><br><em>“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.” </em>- Marcus Aurelius</p><p>However, Holiday believes that the Greek stoic philosopher Epictetus sums it up best:<em> “Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it.”</em><br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Talk is cheap!</h4><p>The point that stoic philosophy is trying to drive home today is that our job is to put our good words into actions. Now more than ever, in the midst of a global pandemic, people argue over what a true hero looks like, and what our duties are as citizens. However, there are not enough people that are willing to actually stand up and do what’s right.</p><p><em>“What will you do? It’s time to step up as Marcus Aurelius did during the plague; as Cato did during the collapse of the republic; as Washington did in 1776; as Stockdale did in that prison camp.”</em></p><p>Now is not the time to talk about our ideals. Our duty is to prove our ideals and turn our good talk into good deeds.</p><p><em>“Show the deeds of a philosopher. Today, tomorrow, always.”</em></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Social Media and US Politics</h4><p>The current US political landscape is unlike any other. Over the years, various forms of media have fanned the flames of polarization, but this is especially true for social media platforms. Social media has acted as a megaphone for less moderate groups to perpetuate ideas that are based on personal vested interests that may only benefit them, as opposed to promoting ideas that would benefit the majority. However, <a href=\"https://hiddentribes.us/\">evidence</a> has shown that the majority of Americans remain more moderate, rational, and reasonable; unfortunately, however, their voices tend to get drowned out.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Unlike previous advances in connectivity (such as phone calls and emails), which brought us direct private interactions, social media has introduced hyperconnected, indirect, and public interactions (such as the like button and “retweet” feature). This has led to widespread intimidation tactics, dishonesty, the perpetuation of harmful conspiracy theories, and a state of constant ideological war.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Seeing that social media platforms are increasingly becoming the new “public squares” wherein people discuss pressing issues and topics, Jonathan Haidt believes social media should install infrastructure to increase user accountability. Similar to how people are not allowed to go out into physical public squares and attack other people anonymously, social media users should not be allowed to open anonymous accounts and get away with attacking other users.</p><p><br></p><h4>The 2020 US Elections: Trump versus Biden</h4><p>Jonathan predicts that the 2020 elections could go either way for a number of factors. Despite the Trump administration’s mismanagement of the pandemic response, Biden himself is far from the perfect Democrat candidate. People tend to gravitate towards vigorous leaders, and Biden does not come across as one.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>At the same time, negative partisanship could play a key role in the upcoming election. Negative partisanship refers to the phenomenon where voting <em>against</em> something you don’t want is a more powerful motivator than voting <em>for </em>something you do want. Therefore, there is a high chance that even though people may not wholeheartedly support Biden, they would rather vote for him than reelect the Trump administration.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of political affiliations, the extreme polarization is standing in the way of pragmatic solutions and a better future for the country. Jonathan Haidt referenced <a href=\"https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-10/\">Federalist No. 10</a>, which warned how political polarization can distract a democratic society from working towards the common good. Jonathan also reminded listeners of a relevant John Stuart Mills quote: “He who only knows his own side of the case knows little of that.”</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all Americans need to work hard towards reducing the political polarization in order to come to an objective view of reality, and make decisions rooted in it. The pandemic has taught everyone that we all still have a lot to learn.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Social Media and Young Minds</h4><p>Since 2012, the rates for anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide among members of Generation Z (persons born after 1996) has been spiking upwards. While both genders have been affected, the depression and anxiety rates have been especially high among girls.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff investigated why this was the case in their book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation-ebook/dp/B076NVFT5P/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\"><em>The Coddling of the American Mind</em></a>. They uncovered several factors, but two of the biggest ones were:</p><ol><li><strong>The growing trend of parental overprotectiveness:</strong> Most members of Generation Z spent significant portions of their childhoods playing indoors on electronic devices. This has led to increased anxiety and fragility when dealing with the outside world as compared to Generation Y (aka Millennials).</li><li><strong>Too early exposure to social media:</strong> Research has shown that social media impacts mental health negatively. There are certain things that young minds simply aren’t equipped to deal with yet, and social media is one of them.</li></ol><p></p><p>Jonathan’s survey of middle schoolers found that social media increases their anxiety and self-consciousness as opposed to making them more secure or comfortable with who they are. This is why Jonathan is advocating for systemic (school-wide, even nationwide) changes that discourage parents from exposing their children to social media too early.</p><p></p><p>Jonathan is not against electronic devices and screens as long as they are used to facilitate direct interactions; the problem lies with the impact of the indirect interactions as mentioned in the first section.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

A follow-up to the report can also be found <a href=\"https://hiddentribes.us/midterms-update/\">here</a>.</p><p></p><p>Jonathan also referenced <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.30.3.133\">Prof. Thomas Gilovich’s research</a> of the role that motivated reasoning plays in people’s interpretation and acceptance of information.

      "Super_Section": "<p><em>Disclaimer: The information discussed by Dr. Rhonda Patrick is not meant to suggest that Vitamin C is an outright cure for COVID-19. There are numerous ongoing trials around the world to see if the intravenous (IV) administration could play a role in curing COVID-19, but there is no data confirming its effectiveness yet.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>About Vitamin C</h4><p>It is a well-known antioxidant that supports numerous physiological processes and protects macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.). While most animals can synthesize their own Vitamin C, humans can only acquire it from food and supplements.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to remember that there is a world of difference between the effects of oral intake and IV intake of Vitamin C. After all, the IV administration of Vitamin C achieves a blood plasma concentration level that is 68 times higher than the maximum level that can be achieved with oral administration.&nbsp;</p><p>Orally-administered Vitamin C is absorbed in the small intestine, while IV administration bypasses that process. Inside the liver, Vitamin C gets broken down into intermediate molecules and gets distributed throughout the body’s tissues.</p><p><br></p><h4>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C</h4><p>A person’s RDA depends on numerous factors, such as age, sex, life stage, and lifestyle. Pregnant women, people who regularly smoke or consume alcohol, or patients with certain medical conditions or who are undergoing certain treatments (such as dialysis), are examples of people with increased Vitamin C needs. These factors can also affect the absorption of Vitamin C.&nbsp;</p><p>The average RDA of Vitamin C for adult men is 90 milligrams per day and 75 milligrams per day for women. But scientists believe there is enough evidence to increase the RDA for adults to 200 milligrams a day, and that doing so could potentially reduce their risk for chronic diseases.</p><p><br></p><h4>The role of Vitamin C</h4><p>Vitamin C boosts immune function by protecting immune cells and reducing the death of T-cells. There is <a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1837634/\">evidence</a> that the supplementation of Vitamin C can reduce the severity and duration of common cold symptoms.</p><p>Vitamin C has also <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/4/708/htm\">proven effective</a> in reducing the amount of time patients are kept on mechanical ventilation. It may even <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/493f/498fdf89dae2e577fb14c1834928ef1d298e.pdf?_ga=2.47798247.1533343800.1589885681-1001545430.1589885681\">reduce pneumonia risk</a> and also be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06161\">protective against lung cancer</a>. Vitamin C could hinder cancer cells from utilizing glucose for survival and growth while also interacting with the iron found in those cancer cells to <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2017.07.008\">produce hydrogen peroxide</a>, which contributes to the <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.redox.2016.10.010\">death of cancer cells</a> while <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/1601943\">leaving healthy cells undamaged</a>.</p><p>Some <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005?via%3Dihub\">epidemiological studies</a> have linked endurance activities to a higher risk of upper respiratory infections; it is possible that Vitamin C (<a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s00421-003-0816-4\">alone</a> or when <a href=\"https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.267419\">combined with Vitamin E</a>) could positively/negatively impact the effects of endurance activities. <a href=\"https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-3-35\">Findings</a> also suggest that Vitamin C can help with fat burning.&nbsp;</p><p>From infancy up until old age, Vitamin C has also been shown to support brain function and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318013919_Does_Vitamin_C_Influence_Neurodegenerative_Diseases_and_Psychiatric_Disorders\">decrease the risk of neurodegenerative diseases</a> (such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons, etc.) by reducing brain oxidative damage. When Vitamin C supplements conventional treatment, it has been shown to be effective in treating <a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2019/3082437/\">myocarditis</a> in children and <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1001/jama.2019.11825\">sepsis</a>.</p><p>When used as a supplement to chemotherapy, there is some evidence that Vitamin C can <a href=\"https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2007.22.1.7\">improve patients’ quality of life</a>. And thanks to its antioxidant activity, Vitamin C might even play a role in <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1089/jmf.2006.9.440\">increasing male fertility</a>. Finally, for both oral and IV administration, Vitamin C has proven effective in <a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/article/00126097-201606000-00006\">lowering high blood pressure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scirp.org/pdf/MRI20120200001_37627273.pdf\">reducing inflammation</a>.</p><p><br></p><h4>Side effects of Vitamin C</h4><p>Clearly, Vitamin C is beneficial and generally safe. However, not abiding by the oral 2000 milligram upper intake daily limit could lead to gastrointestinal problems. Furthermore, people with high levels of iron in their blood should be careful with Vitamin C.&nbsp;</p><p>IV administration of Vitamin C could lead to a wide variety of side effects (ranging in seriousness from nausea to the rupturing of red blood cells), especially in <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.7326/0003-4819-82-6-810_1\">cancer patients</a>.</p><p>While many are concerned that Vitamin C intake could lead to kidney stones, this is a low risk for healthy people.

      "Super_Section": "<h4>The second order effects of COVID-19</h4><p></p><p>Emerson Spartz and some of his co-creators put out an article about the second order effects of the coronavirus pandemic. First order effects result directly from the pandemic, stay-at-home measures, for example. These in turn cause second order effects:since people are staying at home, perhaps the number of babies born will increase, or the number of divorces may go up, or the number of grocery deliveries will shoot up. With the current conditions, this provides a great opportunity for adaptation in businesses that may result in more drive-in or drive-through services, like movies, cafés, etc.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about these second order effects can help you prepare for the future, avoid certain seemingly-inevitable challenges and put you in the perfect position to take advantage of opportunities that are not yet clear to others. Mapping out these logical casualties can prove to be significantly helpful in identifying new and promising business opportunities for novice entrepreneurs. For example, camping and RV-ing may go up as people still want to travel but might not be willing to do so through usual methods (air, train, bus). Businesses and non-profits like <a href=\"https://www.hipcamp.com/\">Hipcamp</a> and <a href=\"https://koa.com/\">KOA</a> that facilitate such travel will likely boom post-lockdown.</p><p></p><p>Although many of the habits and activities currently banned/avoided (handshaking, watching movies in the theatre, dance clubs, etc) may soon return into daily lives, they will still bear the marks of change they underwent during the pandemic. The crisis has pushed companies to rapidly adapt to remote working, and some may now find this mode to be cheaper, faster, more productive. As a result we can expect many companies to continue the remote-work culture even after the social distancing imposition is lifted.</p><p><br></p><h4>Billionaire of the week</h4><p></p><p>Mark Leonard, founder and chairman of Constellation Software, owns a $31 billion business that buys and owns smaller software companies. Early on, Constellation bought businesses that were $ 2-4 million acquisition targets that turned into much bigger returns. Mr. Leonard has a very faint social media presence and not much information about him is public. He writes an annual letter where he states interesting business ideas: for example, vertical market softwares and stock-value-raising incentives for company executives. In this perspective, <a href=\"https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/\">Vista Equity Partners</a> and <a href=\"https://trilogy.com/\">Trilogy Software </a>are also interesting examples.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h4>The fate of an entrepreneur’s aspirations</h4><p>Young amateur entrepreneurs usually start off with the idea of doing something “cool” or “sexy”. But along their journey of understanding how businesses and markets work, they tend to trade away some of this creativity and settle for things that work and provide profit. However, keeping all the practicalities in mind, it can sometimes be rewarding to think about what you think is “cool” or “fun” and try to make it into a feasible business model. It’s important to achieve balance between prudence and excitement.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Group buying: the new way to get ultimate discounts and better advertisement</h4><p></p><p><a href=\"https://pinduoduo.com/\">Pinduoduo</a> is like <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/\">Groupon</a>, but with friends. For example, you can buy a $20 box of tissues for about $8 each if you buy it with other people. All you need to do is create a team, share the link to the product on your usual texting app with your friends, and if they’re in, you’re ready to group-buy! Other sites like <a href=\"https://mashdrop.com/\">MashDrop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/\">Masterclass</a> that have similar group-discounts seem to be quite successful. The reason group schemes work out for such businesses is that essentially they are paying (the discount to) a customer (the primary buyer) to bring them more customers - which is what they would have paid for other forms of advertising. Introduction to a product by friends also increases faith in the purchase of that product which is an added bonus. This scheme would most likely work for digital, high-value products.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

      "Super_Section": "<h4>Quick background on Cuban</h4><p>Mark started his tech career selling PC software for a company in Dallas. With no prior knowledge of this field, he started teaching himself how to program on the job. Eventually, he was fired and used this opportunity to start his own company, MicroSolutions, which he sold to H&amp;R Block a few years later. In 1995 he started the streaming company AudioNet, which later evolved into Broadcast.com. In 1999, this company was sold to Yahoo! at a whopping $5.7 billion. Shortly after that, he bought the Dallas Mavericks NBA team.</p><p>‍</p><h4>His relationship with money and risk</h4><p>Mark went from living as a broke student to becoming a billionaire. After selling Broadcast.com, it was not about the next dollar anymore, and he began to think about how he could help his family and the world by investing in small/medium businesses. </p><p>He also realized life was about having fun, so with the money he made from selling MicroSolutions, he bought a lifetime pass airline ticket and just traveled the world. Control of his time was the most important thing, so he always wanted to be rich enough to be free.</p><p>Mark hates risk and is terrified of it. He fondly remembers what his college basketball coach once said. “Everybody has the will to win but it's only those with the will to prepare for it who win”. He isn’t opposed to risk if he has done the homework for it. Understanding what he is getting into reduces his fear of it.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Post-COVID-19 business advice</h4><p>Mark believes that people quit when they either run out of money or run out of time. He urges entrepreneurs to be brutally honest with themselves to see why something is/is not happening. Everything is going to be crazy after the pandemic, making it the best time for entrepreneurs to come up with something new and different. Expect some world-class companies to be born. </p><p>Although the pandemic may not change the macroeconomics, previous trends that affected businesses negatively will have changed significantly. We can expect a push towards robotics, digital technology and AI. In fact, Mark himself has recently invested in five robotics-based companies.</p><p>Many people have the misconception that you need to be able to raise large amounts of money to run a business. Mark Cuban thinks you don’t. Most big businesses don’t raise money. Sweat equities are all you absolutely need. So if you have an idea, have lost your job, and/or are looking for a new direction, why not go big on our dreams now?</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to think like Mark Cuban</h4><p>Price sensitivity is key while investing in something. When Mark is buying something big on a passion play (like an NBA team), he cares less about the price. But in his other investments, he first looks at his upsides and leverage points. He prefers to make money from the cash-flow of the company rather than its exit, as he has more control on profitability. </p><p>The best investments are the ones that return cash. To Mark, investors from Silicon Valley are like old Hollywood, where everyone wanted to be an actor. No matter who you hire, they think it's a stepping stone to their own business or start-up because there are so many VCs today. </p><p><em>“Sales cures all. There’s never been a company in the history of companies that’s ever succeeded without sales.” </em>– Mark Cuban </p><p>The most common mistake in sales is made in product evaluation, so price your product in relation to the value it provides customers. If it’s your baby and you’re afraid of rejection, you may end up underpricing your products. Remember you can always price higher then work your way down if needed.</p><p>Delegation is the key to accelerating your business. Entrepreneurs must first have a vision for their organization and figure out how to align others on it. The next step is finding managers you can trust. If you expect to accelerate things, you need managers to delegate. In the initial stages of a start-up, it’s important to hire slow and fire fast.</p><p>‍</p>",
